Installing Open64
=================


Introduction
------------

This document explains how to compile and install Open64 on an IA32/X86_64/IA64
based system. The documentation is split into 6 steps:

    * Prerequisites
    * Obtaining the Source Code
    * Compiling
    * Environment Variables
    * Installation
    * Building and installing the FORTRAN libraries

We encourage you to pay attention to the Prerequisites in order to avoid un-
necessary problems later in the build process. Should you ever encounter any
problems with one of the steps, please take a look in the FAQ, the forum or
leave a comment on our web site http://www.open64.net.
If you want to compile and install Open64 X86-PPC cross compiler, there is a few
differences you should notice, see doc/HOWTO-INSTALL-OPEN64-PPC-CROSS

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to compile Open64 successfully, you should meet the following
requirements:

    * Linux based OS
      Currently, Open64 is intensively tested on Linux on IA64/X86_64/IA32.

    * IA32/x86_64/IA64 based machine
      In this release, Open64 is supported and tested for the Itanium 2 and
      IA32/x86_64 architectures. Itanium 1 and generic IA32 is also supported, 
      but not tested carefully.

    * GNU Make
      You should use a up to date version of Make. The system default versions
      on most recently Linux distributions have been tested and work with our
      Makefile.

    * GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
      In order to compile the Open64 source code, you need GCC 3.3.x - 4.2.x.
      Support for GCC 2.x has been dropped since release 1.0. If you don't have
      any of the suggested GCC versions above, we recommend that you to install
      GCC 4.1.x.


Obtaining the Source Code
-------------------------

To compile Open64 you need to obtain the source code first.

There are two ways:

    * Obtain the Source Code as Archive
      You can download the source code from Sourceforge.net
      You will find the links to the different versions in our download section.
      (http://www.open64.net/download.html)

      Extract the source code and the prebuild binaries/libraries

        tar xzf open64-4.2.tar.gz

    * Obtain the Source Code from our Subversion Repository
      You can also obtain the latest version of our source code from the sub-
      version repository.
      To get the latest version issue the following command:

        svn export https://svn.open64.net/svnroot/open64/trunk open64

      This will copy the latest code to the directory open64.

      You can also surf through our subversion repository online.
      (http://svn.open64.net)

Compiling
---------

The open64 build process has been changed to use the autoconf tool that
many other opensource products use.  In the old build process, it was
necessary to set variables on the make command to control the build;
MACHINE_TYPE, BUILD_OPTIMIZE, and TOOLROOT arguments were passed to the
make command to control what type of open64 compiler to build.

In the new build process, these arguments are passed to the configure
script (using a different syntax) and then the 'make all' and 'make
install' commands are run without any arguments.

Here is a mapping for some of the old make options to configure options:

	Makefile setting	configure option
	MACHINE_TYPE=i386	--target=i386-unknown-linux-gnu(1)
	MACHINE_TYPE=ia64	--target=ia64-unknown-linux-gnu
	BUILD_OPTIMIZE=DEBUG	--with-build-optimize=DEBUG
	BUILD_COMPILER=GNU	--with-build-compiler=GNU
	TOOLROOT=/opt/open64	--prefix=/opt/open64

(1) If you are building on an 386/x86_64 system, the target will
    default to building a 32 bit compiler with 32 and 64 bit libraries
    and you do not have to use this option.

Other differences between the old and new build are that 'make' or 'make
all' now builds both the compiler and the libraries.  It is no longer
neccessary to run 'make all' to build the compiler and then 'make lib'
to build the libraries.

Additionally, the libraries that need to be compiled with the open64
compiler will be built using the compiler that was just created during
the make process.  A seperate open64 compiler is not needed to build
these libraries.

To build open64 create a directory (obj) somewhere not underneath the
open64 directory containing the source files.  Switch to that directory
and execute the commands:

  <path-to-open64-dir>/open64/configure
  make all

  If you want to build a debuggable compiler you can add the
  "--with-build-optimize=debug" argument to the configure command.

  If you know where you want to install the compiler you build, add
  "--prefix=<path>" to the configure command and after running make
  to build the compiler you can run "make install" to install the
  compiler in the path specified by the --prefix argument.  The default
  prefix is /usr/local.

  1. Building the compiler on x86_64
  By default, on x86_64 machines, the compiler will be built in 32 bit
  mode and libraries will be built in 32 and 64 bit modes to support
  compilation in either mode.  You can build 64 bit executables by 
  specifying "--build=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu" on the configure command.

  2. some tips on Ubuntu machines
  If you are building the compiler on Ubuntu machine, you need to install the
  following tools first:

    awk, csh, bash, gmake, flex and bison,

  On some Ubuntu distributions, you need to change the symbol link '/bin/sh'
  to '/bin/bash' to make the scripts work.
  If you met the following error:
  ##./table INTERNAL ERROR: Unexpected line: Abort
  ##sh: line 1: 27052 Segmentation fault      ./table <OPTIONS.P
  you need to make sure the awk is linked to mawk on your ubuntu machine

  3. libraries
  Libraries used to be built seperately from the compiler, but now the
  libraries as well as the compiler are built as part of the default
  make target.  The libraries are built using the newly built compiler

Environment Variables
---------------------

Open64 used to use the environment variable TOOLROOT to specify the
installation location and to help the compiler find libraries and
binaries.  TOOLROOT should no longer be used and the installation
location should be specified via the --prefix argument to configure.

Warning!!!
If you have TOOLROOT set it could still affect where open64 looks for 
libraries and executables.

Installation
------------

Once you have done "make all" to make the compiler, "make install" will
copy it to the location specified by the --prefix argument to configure.
If --prefix was not used the default install location is in /usr/local.


Congratulations. You have succsessfully installed Open64. Have fun.

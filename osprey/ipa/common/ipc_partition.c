   /* This has not yet been ported.  Until it is ported I only define
    * the routines needed for ipc_symtab_merge purposes here.  Once
    * ported we probably need to revisit what should or should not be
    * done here, since I assume we will use the merged WHIRL symbol table
    * to do many things that up till now have been done with the ELF
    * symbol table.

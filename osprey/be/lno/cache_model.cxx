*** 		GENERAL NOTES ON THE SGI CACHE MODEL  
***
*** (1.0) THE CACHE MODEL 
***
*** (1.1) The Alternatives 
***
*** The reuse model is based upon uniformly generated sets and vector
*** spaces.  It was a tough call, whether to use this, or a more ad-hoc
*** model (which would have had more special cases but would have been
*** easier because we wouldn't have needed to implement vector spaces,
*** which are a pain).  Vector spaces would have lost out to the ad-hoc
*** approach, except that I wanted the model to be robust and cheap
*** in the face of skewing.  Skewing won't happen in this first
*** implementation,  but it's nice to not have to throw everything away
*** for the next implementation, anyway.  Also, the prefetching algorithm
*** probably functions best with prefetching also, so might as well
*** bite the bullet.
***
*** We could have based our approach on some sort of counting method
*** that computes very close to the actual size of the footprint, as
*** I believe Jalby and Gannon propose.  However, the approach in this code
*** is significantly more straightforward than their approach, and should
*** give very good answers almost all the time.
***
*** NOTE: Rohit's cache model used in the prefetcher incorporates the best
*** aspects of this model combined with nice improvements, including
*** better ability to model multiple levels of cache.  Also, considering
*** the similarity of blocking and prefetching, it might be a significant
*** cleanup (and speedup) to combine the two.  But not necessarily -- they
*** might just be too different.  Not really sure, but this is good for now.
*** The model implemented here assumes that we know exactly which loops
*** we are blocking.  We block our loops, and so they (or strips of them)
*** fit into the cache and nothing else does.  This is much simpler and
*** faster than the prefetching model.  It's wrong in that sometimes
*** loops further out will also fit in the cache because of small loop
*** bounds.  We don't consider loops outside the SNL yet, but when we
*** do, will Rohit's model help?
***
***
*** (1.2) The Role of Footprints and Blocking Factors 
***
*** In the following discussion, array references with square brackets, 
*** e.g. a[i,j], are arrays stored in row-major order (C, Ada, Whirl), 
*** while those in round brackets, e.g. a(i,j), are stored in column- 
*** major order (Fortran). 
***
*** Suppose we have the nest
***
***	for i1 = 1, N1	
***	 for i2 = (blocked size N2, a.k.a. B2)
***	  for i3 = (blocked size N3, a.k.a. B3)
***	   ...
*** If N1 is not constant, it may be fine to assume 100, or some similar
*** constant value.
***
*** Let F2 be the quantity of bytes touched by all iterations of
*** i2, i3, ... and let F1 be the quantity of data touched in all
*** iterations of i1, i2, i3, ... .  This blocking is non-sensical
*** unless the reuse in adjacent iterations of i1 is taken advantage
*** of, and that's only possible if in loops further in, reuse is taken
*** advantage of to a very large extent.  Thus F2 is really
*** a reasonable estimate of the data the cache requires to execute
*** i2, i3, ... , because there should be very few misses of reused
*** data at this level.  Misses of reused data in the i1 loop may cause F1
*** to understimate the bandwidth needed to execute all iterations
*** of i1, however.  (This assumption that reuse occurs from i2 in, and
*** outside i1, and maybe at i1, is the assumption that Rohit's model
*** can improve upon.)
***
*** Note the subtlety:  Although we have not necessarily chosen any Bs yet,
*** we know that we will choose them so that reuse in i2, i3, etc are
*** achieved, so therefore we can assume reuse in i2, i3, etc are achieved.
*** If we chose a B such that this reuse did not occur,
*** then this tiling is silly, and better code can be generated with a
*** different tiling, e.g. not stripping the i2 loop.  Also, it is possible
*** that the i1 loop has so few iterations that reuse can occur outside it,
*** or that one of the inner loops has so few iterations that the B that
*** would have been chosen would be too large.
***
*** Small loop bounds are accounted for, when they are in the SNL.  When
*** a loop bound is small, the model realizes that the blocksize
*** need not be larger than that amount, and if the blocksize is that amount,
*** it doesn't block it.  If the iteration count is very small, the model
*** will even realize that less of the cache is used and use higher
*** tripcounts for the other loops.  TODO OK: Note
*** that if the inner loop has small loop bounds, and loops outside it
*** cannot be tiled with this inner loop, then there is an innermost SNL of
*** depth 1 and we are done.  But better would be to transform outer SNL's
*** for locality by seeing if all loops inside have small loop bounds, and
*** if so, tiling anyway.  For a machine with a big cache, this could be very
*** important, since the innermost's "small bounds" wouldn't have to be too
*** small.  I think this is very doable, and also very important.  E.g.
*** Householder QR can have the outer two loops blocked but the inner loop
*** cannot be (dependence (+,+,*)).  There is a large range of problem sizes
*** for which run-time performance improvement will be significant, although
*** if N is too large then just the inner loop will overrun the cache.
*** B will end up being a function of N: the larger N, the smaller B.
*** 
*** 
*** (1.3) Relating the Footprint to Cache Requirements 
***
*** We are concerned about reusing data in i1 while still having space in
*** the cache.  The quantity of new data brought in by each iteration of i1
*** is roughly ND = (F1-F2)/(N1-1). 
***
*** Note that in the following example, if we suppose a cache line has 8 
*** words,  
***
***	do i = 1, N
***	 do j = 1, B
***	  a(i)
***
*** the inner loop must bring in at least 8 words of data and the outer loop 
*** will brings in one new word per iteration, reusing the other 7, because 
*** it's reusing the cache line, which counts.  
***
*** There is a maximum distance d in the outermost loop for which we are i
*** required to keep data in memory.  In the above example, d = 7, since as 
*** long as the data used in iteration i is still available in iteration i+7, 
*** reuse will be successful.  Later we discuss how to compute d.
***
*** Suppose the cache holds C elements.  Then the cache needs to hold
*** F2+ND*d elements to take advantage of all the reuse. 
***
*** Let p be between 0 and 1 (typical value: 0.1 or 0.15) -- p is part
*** of the machine description, along with C, computed from cache
*** characteristics. The quantity p*C is the effective cache size.  The 
*** factor p is less than 1 when the cache is not fully associative, 
*** which is currently the case for all caches in SGI machines today.  
***
*** If F2+ND*d <= p*C, then almost all the potential data
*** is reused.  Otherwise, lots of the potentially reused data may be
*** wasted.  See the #defines for more information on this matter.
*** Given the reuse, new data, footprints, etc, it is easy to come up
*** with an equation that tells us the number of misses per iteration,
*** and so the number of cycles per iteration.
***
***
*** (2.0) COMPUTING FOOTPRINTS 
***
*** At this point, we have discussed everything about blocking for one
*** cache level except for computing F1, F2 and d.
***
*** Let's discuss computing F1 and F2; computing d we will take up
*** later.  We use the same approach to compute F1 and F2, since they are
*** really the same problem, with F2 just having one less loop in the nest.
*** So all we have to do is show how to compute F1.  (TODO OK: by
*** computing F1 and F2 independently, one could argue, correctly, that
*** we have not taken advantage of the similarity of the problems, and
*** so we do twice as much work as necessary.  True, but it's apparently
*** not the bottleneck.)  So now we show how to compute F1. The discussion 
*** will be in terms of elements, but the code, to allow for different 
*** element sizes (floats and doubles, for example) does all its computa-
*** tion using bytes rather than elements.
***
***
*** (2.1) Single Reference, Single Element Cache Line Case   
***
*** We begin with the case of a loop nest with a simple reference of the 
*** form:
***	    _
***	for i
***	      _     _   _
***	 x [ Hi + A.k + c ]
***                                                      _     _
*** This means a matrix H multiplies the index variables i.  A.k is a matrix 
*** product, where k are variables that are not index variables, e.g. N.
*** Finally, c is a vector of integer constants.  Uniformly generated
*** references have the same H and A -- they only differ in by an integer
*** constant in each dimension.  I use the subscript _s to indicate that
*** the stride one dimension is ignored.  E.g. H_s is H with the last row
*** elided.
***
*** Begin by assuming the cache line size is one.  If ker H is null, then
*** the number of elements used are Prod(Ni).  In general, suppose O is
*** the orthogonal subspace of ker H, roughly written O = I - ker H where I
*** is the iteration space.  "Beautify" O so that the basis vectors are
*** elementary basis vectors of I insofar as possible.  Suppose the basis
*** vectors for O are o_i where o_i = sum c_ik e_k.  
***
*** Then the number of items touched by reference x are: 
***
***	   PROD         SUM        P * A_k   
***     OKerH basis    basis      --------   
***      vector i    component     |c_ik|  
***		     c_ik != 0 
***
***     where: P =  PROD |(cij)|  and A_k = N_k (the trip count of loop k) 
***                cij != 0		        (at least for now) 
*** 
***  There are some notes and exceptions: 
***
***  (1) This formula holds as long as all |c_ik| <= 16.  If not, we pretend
***      c_ik = 0, and add another basis vector j with c_jk = 1 and c_jl = 0
***      for l != k.  This has the effect of treating a(i+23*j) as if it were
***	 a(i,j).  In other words, a(i+23*j) looks like a linearized reference.
***  (2) The value of 16 is chosen arbitrarily.  Michael wanted it big enough
***	 so that if we unroll by 16, this work as if you would expect. 
***  (3) The original formula was: 
***
***	   PROD             SUM        P * A_k   
***     OKerH basis  ((    basis      --------  ) - (P-1))  
***      vector i        component     |c_ik|  
***		         c_ik != 0 
***
*** 	  Right now, we don't subtract this term, because we were afraid 
***	  the result would go negative.  But Michael believed that it  
***	  might be possible to include this term back in.  (It will take 
***	  some more time to figure out what it signifies.) 
***
***	Let's look at an example: 
***
***	for i
***	 for j
***	  x[j] = y[i+j]
***
***	Suppose the vectors look like [i j].  Then for reference x, 
***	as basis for ker H is [1 0], and a basis for OKerH is [0 1].     
***	[c_00 c_01] = [0 1].  P = |c_01| = 1.  The result is: 
***	1 * N_j / |1| = N_j.  For reference y, a basis for is [1 1]. 
***     so that [c_00 c_01] = [1 1], P = |c_00| * |c_01| = 1, and 
***	the result is: 1 * N_i / |1| + 1 * N_j / |1| = N_i + N_j. 
***
*** Note that OkerH means the orthogonal space to the kernel of H.  So it's 
*** the basis vectors of the space without temporal locality.  If the cache
*** line size is larger than the element size, the above formula must be 
*** multipied by the cls/eltsz, where cls is the cache line size, and  
*** eltsz is the element size.  
***
***  
*** (2.2) Multiple Word Cache Lines
***
*** Ok, what happens when a cache line holds more than one word?  Let the
*** cache line size be cls elements.  We want to find which loop is the one
*** reusing the cache line but not accounted for already in the number of
*** elements touched.  First of all, we check that dim(ker H) < dim(ker Hs),
*** where Hs is H with the stride one row removed.  If the inequality is
*** true, there is cache line use that is not accounted for in the temporal
*** reuse.  If the inequality does not hold, then use the formula above as
*** before. 
***
*** But if it does hold, then suppose the reference whose stride one
*** component looks like k1*i1+k2*i2+... .  Let L = {j: k_j != 0 and
*** j doesn't appear alone in another index besides possibly the stride one
*** index.}  L cannot be empty if dim(ker H) < dim(ker Hs).  (This is easy 
*** to prove by assuming L is empty and concluding ker H = ker Hs).  So 
*** choose j such that |k_j| is the minimum of all |k_l| where l in L.  
*** This j loop is the one we will call the "stride one loop".  This is a 
*** heuristic, but it will work in almost all cases.  (Again, Rohit's model 
*** does a better job.)
***
*** [What is the reasoning behind this?  Consider the case a[k,2*i+j+k].
*** Assuming Whirl's row major order, the stride one component is 2*i+j+k,
*** which indexes three loops, i, j, and k.  We're looking to choose the
*** loop "l" for which advancing the index "l" gives the smallest incre-
*** ment, which is hopefully less than a cache line.  The loop "k" is  
*** generally a bad choice, because advancing k will advance us D_0+1 
*** elements, where D_0 is the length in elements of the first dimension
*** of "a".  Most of the time D_0 will be substantially larger than 1. 
*** This leaves us with a choice of i or j.  Since advancing i moves us 
*** two elements, while advancing j moves us 1 element, we will select 
*** j as the stride 1 loop.  RJC] 
***
*** Now define X by: 
***
***     X = min(|k_j|,cls).  
***
*** Redefine A_k as: 
***
***	A_k = N_k,                   for k, a non-"stride one loop"
***	      (N_j-1)*X + cls        for j, the "stride one loop"
***
*** Using this in our original formula: 
***
***	   PROD         SUM        P * A_k   
***     OKerH basis    basis      --------   
***      vector i    component     |c_ik|  
***		     c_ik != 0 
***
***     where: P =  PROD |(cij)|  and A_k as above. 
***                cij != 0		 
***
*** yields our general formula for a single reference.
***
*** However, we should note one additional point, when there is no stride
*** one loop, we need to multiply by the cls in elements to get the entire
*** footprint.
***
*** (2.3) Modifying X for Multiple References 
***
*** However, there are some corrections we'd like to make to this formula.
*** Consider a[3*i] and a[3*i+1] with a cls of 1.  In each case, we get X = 
*** min(3,1) = 1, yielding a sum of 2*N_i for both references.  But this  
*** overestimates the data pulled into the cache, because the two references
*** share cache lines.  Hence, we use a modified formula for X in this case:
***
***	X = min(|k_j|, cls+spread)
***
*** where "spread" is the absolute value of the difference between the 
*** largest and smallest constant terms (signs included).  In this example,
*** spread = 1, if the two references were a[6*i+6] and a[6*i-5], the 
*** spread would be 11.  This X is used once for the entire group of 
*** references. 
***
*** [This formula will hold as long as the spread is small compared to 
*** the cache line size.  To illustrate it's validity, for strides greater
*** than the cache line size, assume that we have two references which are 
*** a distance S apart where S is smaller than the cache line size cls.  
*** The probability that the first reference and second reference are in 
*** the same cache line is (cls-S)/cls.  So the expected amount of data
*** pulled in is [1*(cls-S)/cls+2*S/cls]*cls*N_j = (1-S/cls)*cls*N_k, 
*** yielding a value of X = (1-S/cls)*cls = cls + S. RJC] 
*** 
*** TODO: This formula is completely wrong when the spread is a multiple
*** of the cache line size.  To see this, consider the case of two refer-
*** ences a[3*i] and a[3*i+3], with a cache line size of 1.  Here our 
*** formula gives X = min(3,3+3) = 6, when in reality we want something 
*** closer to 3. Michael notes:   
***
*** When these things go wrong, they matter.  (Perhaps change the data
*** structure for RG_NODE, so that rather than just a max and min stride,
*** there is a bit vector indicating which strides occur.  Easy enough, and
*** then Formula_For_Ak would check the bit vector.  I'm using this formula
*** because it works best in the common case of 3i, 3i+1, 3i+2 that we see
*** in register unrolling.)
***
*** [In any case, this is not fixed in the current version of the cache 
*** model. (RJC 30-JUN-1997).  I'll also add that that the formula isn't
*** right for the case where the spread is close to the cache line size.
*** Instead of: 
***
***   X = min(|k_j|, cls+spread)
***
*** I'll contend that at least in the case of two references, we should 
*** use: 
***
***   X = min(|k_j|, cls+S)  where S = min(M, cls-M) and M = mod(spread, cls) 
***
*** To see this, note that the case that the references are cls-1 elements
*** apart is equivalent to the case where they are 1 apart, since now the  
*** second fetch of the first reference is 1 apart from the first fetch of
*** the second reference. 
***  
*** But, for the most part it is rare that the absolute value of any 
*** coefficient is greater than 1, and since the cache line size is 
*** generally about 4 or 8 or so elements, it is normally the case that 
*** X = (min|k_j|), and this whole discussion rarely matters.  RJC]
***
*** (2.4) Modification for Large Cache Lines 
***
*** In Michael's original model, identified a single loop as the stride 
*** one loop.  We used one formula for the stride one loop, which included
*** the edge effects from the cache line, and another formula for the other
*** loops which did not include this term.  So, for example, if we are 
*** analyzing: 
***
***	do j = 1, n 
***	  do i = 1, n
***	    a(i,j) = 0 
***	  end do 
***	end do 
***
***  With a cache line size of 8 elements/cache line.  We would compute 
***  the footprint of a(i,j) in the two loops as (TC_i + 7)*TC_j, where 
***  TC_i is the trip count of the "i" loop and TC_j is the trip count 
***  of the "j" loop. Here the stride one loop "i" contributes (TC_i + 7) 
***  while the non-stride-one loop "j" contributes TC_j. 
***       
***  In the case of three loops: 
***   
***	do k = 1, n
***	  do j = 1, n 
***	    do i = 1, n 
***	      a(i,j,k) = 0 
***	    end do 
***	  end do 
***	end do 
***
***  The footprint is (TC_i + 7)*TC_j*TC_k.  Notice here that both "j" and
***  "k" contribute the same factor to the footprint when TC_j == TC_k == n.
***  If we based our decision solely on the footprint, then, we might con-
***  clude that having "k" as the second innermost loop is just as good as 
***  having "k" as the second innermost loop, which is generally not the 
***  case.  This is because while neither "j" nor "k" is stride one, "j" 
***  is closer to stride one than "k" is.  
***
***  Prior to the modification I'm about to describe, we still chose the 
***  (k,j,i) order as the best order because we marked both the "i" loop 
***  (which was stride one) and the "j" loop, which was the next most 
***  stride one loop, as being reuse loops, and so we included "i" and "j"
***  in the tile, while "k" was in the tile only when it was the required
***  inner loop (and so lost because it was not stride one).  However, 
***  the footprint for the choices (j,k,i) and (k,j,i) were the same.  
***  (We just never looked at (j,k,i) as a choice.) 
***
***  The above technique worked fine for the case of three loops, but 
***  fell apart for the case of four or more loops.  In this case, it 
***  was not possible to distinguish (l,k,j,i) from (k,l,j,i).  Also 
***  in the parallelism model, where we arbitrate cache costs solely based
***  on the footprint, we failed to see the desired differentiation. 
***
***  So, we've done the following.  For non-stride-one loops, we now 
***  compute an edge effect penalty which is equal to (cls-1)/PROD(TC_i)   
***  where TC_i are the trip counts of all of the loops with strides 
***  smaller than this loop. 
*** 
***  For example, conside the three nested loop above, and look at the 
***  (j,i,k) order.  Suppose the trip counts of these loops are (100,v0,v1).
***  For "j" our contribution was 100, but is now 100 + 7/v0.  Likewise 
***  for "k" our contribution was v1, but is now v1+7/(100*v0).   
***
***  This is by no means exact, but it does let us differentiate between
***  our various loop choices.  It is especially important when the cache
***  line is large (say for the L2 cache, which has a line of 32 single
***  precision or 16 double precision elements.                   
***
***  To implement this, we keep an array called Stride_Loops[] in each 
***  RG structure.  Stride_Loops[0] is the stride one loop,  Stride_Loops[1]
***  is the next largest stride loop, etc., through all of the loops. 
***  I use this array when I'm computing A_k for a non-stride one loop, 
***  it tells me which loops have lower stride than the "k" loop. 
***  
*** (2.5) When the Innermost Loop Doesn't Need to Be Blocked 
***
*** In one important case, adding cls to account for edge effects is too 
*** pessimistic.  What if we had a[i,j], and j isn't blocked so that it 
*** iterates over everything, and i is in the tile, too.  In this case (only),
*** It is enough to use (N_j-1)*X+cls/N_i rather than (N_j-1)*X+cls.  We
*** divide cls by N_i because there is only one edge effect to account for
*** over all of the iterations of i rather than N_i edge effects. 
***
***
*** For example, if i is in the block, a stride one loop, and dimension 
*** a[D_i, D_j], then for the reference a[i,j]:
***
***     A_j = (N_j-1)*X < D_j ? (N_j-1)*X + cls :
***                             (N_j-1)*X + cls/N_i
***
*** That was the simple case: no reuse from different references.  Now consider
*** reuse from distinct references.  First note that the number of occurences
*** within a loop of a[i] are irrelevant.  Either the leading one hits or not,
*** and then all other ones hit.  So loop body instance counts of a reference
*** don't matter, and neither do reads and writes.  Actually, writes cost more
*** but we ignore that.  Also, there is little reuse between x[i] and x[j],
*** to first order, or even between x[i] and x[i+m] (unless m is small, but
*** if it's a constant we have already discovered that by now, most likely).
*** There is only significant reuse amongst UNIFORMLY GENERATED REFERENCES,
*** those that are identical in form except possibly for a compile-time
*** integer constant.  These observations hold whether or not there is more
*** than one element in a uniformly generated reference.
***
***
*** (2.6)  Accounting for Multiple References  
***
*** The new concept for group reuse is reference groups.  We do not exactly
*** use the Carr, et. al. concept, since our approach is much more general
*** and suitable for blocking (and wrapping fish).  First of all, let's give
*** the punch line.  The formula changes only for A_k:
***
***	A_k = N_k + Max_k - Min_k,             for k, a non-"stride one loop"
***	      (N_j-1)*X + cls + Max_j - Min_j  for j, the "stride one loop"
***
*** (Actually, as before, if (N_j-1)*X+Max_j-Min_j >= D_j, then divide the 
*** cls in the stride one loop formula by N_i, where "i" is the next outer 
*** stride one loop.)
***
*** That formula is not for a reference, but for a reference group (for a 
*** single reference, Max-Min is always zero, giving the answer above when 
*** there is only one element in the group).  The footprint is simply the sum 
*** over reference groups.  So let's discuss how references are grouped into 
*** reference groups, and how Max and Min are chosen.  First, though, notice 
*** how the formula has changed.  Pairs of references touch identical elements 
*** except at the edges of the iteration space, in effect resulting in extra 
*** iterations, although in the stride one case, only extra elements of a 
*** cache line are used.
***
*** For example, consider a(i,j), a(i+1,j) and a(i,j+1).  It turns out that
*** these will all go in the same ref group for a doubly nested loop over i
*** and j.  If it were just a(i,j), it would use (N_i-1+cls)*Nj elements.
*** With the other two references, instead the answer is (N_i+1+cls)*(N_j+1) 
*** elements.  As you see, two more elements per iteration of the i loop 
*** (probably less than a cache line), but an extra row of data is needed.  
***
*** Note that this formula I've presented is cute and reasonably accurate, 
*** but is very much a heuristic.  For example, if to the above set of 
*** references we added a fourth, a(i+1,j+1), it turns out that the max and 
*** mins wouldn't change.  The actual answer would be that we use only one 
*** additional element, less than a cache line, in the doubly nested loop, 
*** so our error is tiny.  Still, its a heuristic.
***
*** Reference groups are found as follows.  If the references are not
*** uniformly generated, they go in different reference groups.  If they
*** are, but H_s*i = c2_s-c1_s has no solution, they also go in different
*** refgroups (cannot use the same cache line).  E.g. a(j,i,i+1) and
*** a(j,i+1,i+1) go in different refgroups, because there is no solution
*** to 
***
***    [1 0][i] = [1]
***    [1 0][j]   [0]
***
*** [Here are some details of the calculation: 
***
***       [0 1]                    [0]       [0]
***   H = [1 0]  H_s = [1 0]  c2 = [1]  c1 = [0]  c2_s = [1]  c1_s = [0]
***	  [1 0]        [1 0]       [1]       [1]         [1]         [1] 
***
*** In each case, we drop the first row out of H, c2, and c1 to form H_s,
*** c2_s, and c1_s, because the each row corresponds to a component in the
*** array reference, the first row corresponds to the first component and 
*** since the arrays are in column major order, this is the stride-one 
*** component. RJC]
*** 
*** 
*** (2.7) Implementation of Reference Groups in this Code
*** 
*** In the code below, an RG (short for "reference group", although that's
*** an oversimplification) holds a list of reference groups.  The reference
*** groups in the list would all fall into the same reference group, but
*** the constants in the index expressions vary too much.  For example,
*** a(i) and a(i+100) perhaps do not belong in the same reference group,
*** because in a typical blocked loop there will not be reuse.  Otherwise
*** they would go in the same reference group.  So an RG holds all references
*** that would go in the same reference group if the constants were small
*** enough.  Each RG_NODE is a member of the list.  These RG_NODEs do not
*** actually have lists of references.  Instead they have spreads in each
*** loop index dimension.  A reference falls within 20 iterations of another
*** reference in all dimensions, it is deemed to go in the same reference
*** RG_NODE (ie reuse is achieved); otherwise, it goes into a different RG_NODE
*** in the same RG.  This way, coalescing of RG_NODEs is easy: if we have
*** a(i) and a(i+25), which are in different groups, it's easy when we see
*** a(i+12) to combine all these into one RG_NODE.  It turns out that that's
*** the right thing to do when one examines the model.  
***
*** TODO OK: note that 20 is a heuristic.  Really, the right number is the 
*** blocksize, the number of iterations, possibly different for each dimen-
*** sion.  That number is often unknown.  20 is a good guess, and will lead 
*** to reasonable answers in most cases, especially since programmers do not 
*** often write a(i) and a(i+20) without intervening references, and when 
*** they do, it's often more like a(i) and a(i+1000) in which case we do the 
*** right thing anyway.  It's not a big issue. (Note: MAX |x_i-y_i| is the 
*** norm being used to get the distance.	       i 
***
*** Let's look more closely within an RG_NODE.  Each dimension has a max
*** and a min, the distance in the iteration space from the representative
*** of the RG.  (Each RG has one representative, so that a new reference
*** need only be compared to the RG, not to each element within it, to
*** understand where reuse occurs.)  Here's an example of the process:
***
***	a(j,i,i)	-> Max_i = 0, Min_i = 0, Max_j = 0, Min_j = 0
***
*** For the first element, the maxs and mins are all zero, since the distance
*** in the iteration space from a(j,i,i) to a(j,i,i), the representative for
*** this RG, is zero.  Additional elements will show how i and j differ from
*** this representative.  A tally of max and min in stride one constants
*** is kept.
***
*** TODO OK: This is only a simple heuristic, not completely accurate.  
*** We may not actually merge this with prefetching, since the assumptions 
*** may be different.  The footprint must be multiplied by (cls+max_s1const
*** -min_s1const).  Two nodes that differ by more than the cache line size 
*** go in different reference groups, but only if dim(Ker H) != dim(Ker H_s).
***
*** Anyway, now add in a(j,i,i+1).  We saw this above,  It goes in a different
*** RG entirely since it cannot touch the same cache line and the previous RG.
*** So let's just forget about it -- it's independent.  (We keep a stack of
*** RG for each array base, and compute the footprint for each array base
*** before going on to the next.)  
***
*** Suppose next we see a(j,i+1,i+1).  It goes in the same RG as the first. 
*** Solving H_s*[i,j] = [1,1], we get i = 1 as an answer. j could be anything,
*** and we use zero in that case.  So the first reference group now has
*** 
***	a(j,i,i)	-> Max_i = 1, Min_i = 0, Max_j = 0, Min_j = 0
***
*** To get the stride difference between a(j,i+1,i+1) and the representative
*** a(j,i,i) along the stride one dimension, let i_2 = [i,j] = [1,0] be our 
*** solution to the above equations.  The stride difference is given by 
*** computing the first component of H * i_2 + c_2 - c_1, where c_2 is the 
*** constant term for the new reference, and c_1 is the constant term for 
*** the representative reference.  In this case, we get [0 1]*[1 0]+0-0 = 0.
*** If we had been analyzing a(j+1,i+1,i+1) against a(j,i,i), we would have 
*** obtained [0 1]*[1 0]+1-0 = 1.  In any case, this formula for the stride:
***
***	stride = H * i_2 + c_2 - c_1  
***
*** works in general. 
***
*** We continue to add in references, consolidating whenever each of the mins 
*** for a particular reference come within 20 of all of the maxes.  For exam-
*** ple, if we see b(i,j) and b(i,j+30), these go in a SIMILAR_REFERENCE_GROUP,
*** but different REFERENCE_GROUPS.  If we now see b(i+2,j+15), we combine it
*** with the first, and the two resultant reference groups are now within
*** 20 in all dimensions, so all three form one reference group.
***
***
*** (2.8) Computing "d" in the Requirement Formula 
***
*** With this result, we can compute F1 and F2.  The required distance "d"
*** is precisely max(Max_i1 - Min_i1) over all the reference groups.  That's 
*** all the theory we need to compute misses per iteration for any blocksizes.
***
***
*** (3.0) THE BLOCKING MODEL
***
*** (3.1) The Square and Rectangular Blocking Models 
***
*** We started out with the idea of having two models, a fast one, which 
*** implemented "square blocking" and a slower, but more versatile one, 
*** called the "rectangular blocking" model.  It turned out that the cost
*** of executing the rectangular blocking model was always acceptable, so 
*** the code below only implements that model. 
***
*** Remember that for N deep loops, we transform to 2*N-1 loops, so there 
*** are N-1 blocking factors to choose.  For example, a three deep loop nest 
*** has two blocking factors.
***
*** In the square model we would choose the same blocking factor for both Bs.
*** Also, for speed reasons is did not distinguish between
***
***     do i by B
***        do j
***           do i = 1, B
***
*** and
***
***     do j by B
***        do i
***           do j = 1, B
***
*** That is, it didn't care which loop is innermost and does not choose
*** different B for the different cases.  Very fast, but not too precise.
*** Meanwhile, the rule for choosing B was that 15% (machine dependent)
*** of the cache would be used.  Period.
***
*** The rectangular model, which is currently used for all of our cache 
*** modeling, is slower than the square model but produces a better result.  
*** Here are the differences from the square model:
***
***   - May result in different B for >=3 deep loop nests.
***   - Loop overhead model included in search, so inner loop B may be 
***     larger and more than 15% of the cache may be used.  The model 
***     iterates to find a minimal cost solution in cycles/iter rather 
***	than aiming for 15% of the cache.
***   - Doesn't reuse previous answers for different inner loops.
***
***
*** (3.2) Computing the Loop Overhead 
***
*** In order to rectangular tile effectively, one has to understand loop
*** overhead.  How can we compute loop overhead?  We'll do it very simply,
*** and improve it later.  We identify three costs which together compose
*** the loop overhead: 
***
***   - Setting up the addresses:  For now, let's assume 3 cycles
***     per distinct reference passed into the cache model.
***   - Software pipelining startup: For now, let's assume 10 cycles.
***   - Register effects (unnecessary copy/restore at loop boundaries)
***     Assume 0 cycles.  Consider this a part of software pipelining 
***     startup.
***
*** [This is not actually the way that we model loop overhead today.  I'll
*** go through the code at some point and write a description. RJC] 
*** 
*** 
*** (3.3) Solving for Block Sizes by Recursive Descent 
*** 
*** So how do we solve for the block sizes?  Recall that the formula for
*** the footprints is a formula whose unknown values are the yet to be 
*** chosen blocksizes.  The formulas for the footprints are used in an
*** overall objective function which gives the cycles per iteration due 
*** to cache and loop overhead.  Our goal is to find the blocksizes which 
*** minimize this function. 
*** 
*** To do this, suppose we are solving for m blocksizes: B1, B2, ..., Bm.
*** We minimize this by recursive binary search.  We choose an arbitrary
*** value for B1, reducing the number of unknowns in our formula to m-1.
*** We then solve for the minimum of this reduced function.  We then at-
*** tempt a different value of B1, form a new formula of m-1 variables, 
*** and minimize this.  If this minumum is smaller than the previous, we
*** retain it, otherwise we retain the original.  We continue until we 
*** find a best value for B1.  The solution of the formula for m-1 vari-
*** ables will then yield the values of B2, B3, ..., Bm.  Note that by 
*** applying this technique recursively, we will eventually end up sol-
*** ving an equation in one unknown Bm, which can be done by simple binary
*** search.     
***
*** Recall that for an n-deep loop nest, there are n-1 variables, so for 
*** a three-deep nest, there are only two levels of binary search, which 
*** is cheap enough.  For deeper nests, we don't actually solve for unique
*** values of B1, B2, ..., Bm, but rather use the same value for B2 = B3 = 
*** ... = Bm. 
***
***
*** (3.4) Testing Different Loop Orders 
***
*** We run the cache model once for each possible inner loop.  Loops are 
*** included in the tile if only if they are judged to have reuse. If we  
*** are computing blocksizes for a two deep nest, we will then have at most 
*** four combinations to evaluate:  {1}, {0,1}, {0}, and {1,0}.  Here the 
*** loops are numbered 0 and 1, the order inside the curly braces is signi-
*** ficant, and the loops listed are those which participate in the tile.  
*** The first of the loops in each list inside the curly braces is the 
*** middle loop, the last is the innermost loop. 
***
*** For three loops, there are at most 2^2 * 3 = 12 combinations to evaluate; 
*** for four loops, this rises to 2^3 * 4 = 32.  At some point this becomes
*** prohibitively expensive.  So for loop nests which have five or more 
*** loops with reuse, we choose the best four loops (in some sense) and 
*** only evaluate these as being part of the tile.   
***
***
*** (3.5) When the Footprint Fits in the Cache
***
*** Important note: Our model is only accurate if data does not fit in the
*** cache.  If the SNL fits in the cache, then the cost is very low.  We
*** currently model it as zero, and thus all configurations of loops are
*** equally good.  So the first thing we do is see that the data used overflow
*** the cache.  If not, return 0.  If so, then we consider subnests to block.
*** Within a subnest, if it overflows the cache, then we can model it just
*** fine.  If not, then there's no point blocking those loops. But we still
*** need an estimate in cycles per iteration, so we can compare this subnest
*** with others, so that we can find the minimum cost subnest. 
***
*** If we don't overflow the cache, it may be possible that by adding 
*** additional outer loops we will reach a point where the loop nest over-
*** flows the cache, and we can come up with an appropriate cost in cycles
*** per iteration.  This is what we are doing in Compute_Actual_Miss_Bytes().
*** We first test to see if the subnest fits in the cache.  If it does, 
*** our model is accurate and we call Compute_Miss_Bytes() to get the 
*** appropriate formula for the miss bytes.  If it doesn't overflow the cache,  
*** it additional loops to until we reach a point where the nest doesn't fit
*** in the cache, and so have satisfied this criterion of our model.  
***
*** Note that if we must add an additional loop to get a subnest which  
*** doesn't fit in the cache, there is no point in blocking the loops 
*** further in, since they already fit in the cache (or the added loop, 
*** since it is the middle loop).  So, we aren't actually evaluating any 
*** blocking choices by doing this, just getting an estimate of the cycles
*** per iteration. 
***
*** In an earlier implementation of the cache model, a subnest which fit
*** in the cache simply returned "fits in cache", and Nest_Model() was 
*** assumed to explore the next configuration out.  But when blocking is 
*** restricted, or pragmas are used, or whatever, then this approach failed.  
***
*** The current approach has been implemented in a fairly cheap way.  
*** It is often the case that the loop that is added has no reuse, and 
*** Compute_Miss_Penalty() is extremely fast in that case.
***
***
*** (3.6) Blocking For Multiple Levels of Cache   
***
*** Yet another note.  The array permute_order[0..depth] holds the
*** permutation transformation we will need to apply to achieve the
*** desired transformation.  So permute_order[0] is loop that will be
*** outermost after permutation, but before tiling.  So, for example,
***
***                    do i'
***    do i      ->     do j
***     do j             do i
***
*** involves an interchange first, then a blocking.  We also have a data
*** structure to indicate the strips (the blocking).  But during computation,
*** we need more.  Essentially, we need to know which loops are available
*** for blocking, particularly when we block for the L2 cache after having 
*** blocked for the L1 cache. 
***
*** To see why, supopose we have blocked for the L1 cache as in the above
*** example.  When we go to block for the L2 cache, the loop order looks 
*** like {i',j}, because we can only block from the outermost loop down to 
*** and including the middle loop.  Note that if we had blocked the above
*** nest like: 
***                    do j'
***    do i      ->     do i
***     do j             do j
***
*** The available loops would be {j',i}, in that order.  The tile inside
*** important, but it's nothing that L2 can transform.  L2 basically thinks 
*** the loop nest is really two deep in this case, with j only available in 
*** chunks equal to the blocksize chosen for the L2 cache.  So we note that:
***
***                             do k'
***                              do l'
***    do i      ->               do i
***     do j                       do j
***      do k                       do k
***       do l                       do l
***        do m                       do m
***
*** the set of loops we can transform at the next level is {k',l',i}.
***
*** We use an array called available_order[] to store the list of the 
*** loops which are available for transformation at this level of the 
*** cache.  (More precisely, the depths of the available loops are what 
*** is stored in this array.)  There are "available_depth+1" elements in 
*** available_order[].  Upon entry to the cache model, available_depth
*** == depth and available_order[] == permute_order[], which is the iden-
*** tity permutation.  
***
*** In addition to available_order[], the multi-level blocking algorithm
*** uses a variable 'stripdepth' to keep track of which loops are part of 
*** an inner blocking nest and cannot be blocked further.  While blocking 
*** a nest of loops for the L1 cache, the value of stripdepth is always 
*** the depth of the innermost loop (in its original position) plus 1. 
*** So in the above example loop nest (i,j,k,l,m), stripdepth == 5 while
*** blocking for L1.  When blocking for the L2 cache, stripdepth may be
*** some value less than it was for L1.  In the above example, stripdepth
*** will be 1, because the (j,k,l,m) subnest cannot be block further.  
*** 
*** (3.7) Blocking for L1, then L2 
***
*** TODO: Note a very important result of our general approach.  We block
*** for L1, then block for L2 afterwards.  In other words, One_Cache_Model() 
*** is called for each cache level sequentially, rather than including all 
*** the caches in one model.  Consequently, we optimize for L1 first and 
*** leave L2 to clean up the mess.  
***
*** This means that we are essentially saying that modelling for L1 is more 
*** important than modelling for L2.  This is will be true, if L1 misses are 
*** usually just as important as L2 misses, and the data fits in L2 but  
*** not in in L1.  
***
*** Still, when things don't fit in L2, there can be modelling problems 
*** because a blocking that worked for L1 might be bad for L2.  This is a 
*** real problem and occasionally we block for L1, when it would have been 
*** better to not block, because the blocking makes things worse for L2.  
*** There's a dilemma here: if we model for both L1 and L2 simultaneously, 
*** then we are suboptimal when things DO fit in L2, which is quite common.
*** In the other hand, the cost of a cache miss for L2 is often many times
*** the cost of an L1 cache miss, so the effect of blocking for the L1
*** cache when the data doesn't fit in the cache will really be in the  
*** noise. 
***  
*** What should we do?  A run-time test?  Then we'd also have to write all 
*** the code to analyze L1 and L2 simultaneously, or somehow return lots of 
*** possibilities from the L1 modelling for the L2 to choose amongst.  So I 
*** think what we have now is good enough.  
***
*** [As a side note, applications people at SGI who hand block our codes 
*** generally block for the L2 cache and don't even bother with blocking 
*** for the L1 cache.  RJC] 
***
***
*** (4.0) ADDITIONAL ASPECTS OF THE MODEL 
***
*** (4.1) Overlapping Memory Misses with Machine Cycles 
***
*** Another note.  When the miss rate is deemed to be adequately low, then
*** blocking is not necessary because it can all be hidden anyway.  The
*** cache parameter Cur_Mhd->Load_Op_Overlap tells us what fraction of the
*** miss penalty can be overlapped with machine cycles (e.g. it's zero for a
*** non-blocking cache).  Meanwhile, Typical_Outstanding tells us how many
*** memory ops typically do execute simultaneously.
***
*** If almost all the memory misses can be overlapped with machine misses,
*** then of course the cache penalty is very low.  But, also, we count
*** the TLB penalty less in this case if we're not blocking.  The trouble
*** is that our TLB model is not very good, and especially not too good when
*** we are not blocking.  (Edge effects problems.)   So if we're not blocking
*** and the cache miss rate is low anyway, then we're mostly content to not
*** block, so we reduce the untrustworthy TLB.  Is this a reasonable way to
*** do things?  We also have the cache model parameter that indicates to what
*** extent we trust the TLB in the first place (0 is no trust, 1.0 is full
*** trust).
***
***
*** (4.2) Clean and Dirty Miss Penalties 
***   
*** Another note.  We have a clean miss penalty and a dirty miss penalty.
*** While it's hard to know which misses will be clean or dirty, we can
*** figure out the proportion fairly easily.  For example, suppose we have:
***
***        do i
***	     do j 
***            a(i,j) = a(i,j) + a(i+1,j)
***
*** Here, if the arrays are big, then all the misses will be dirty, because
*** the cache will be filled with lines of a, pretty much all of which will
*** have been written.  If there was also a b(i,j), then half the cache would
*** be a and half b, so roughly half the misses would be dirty.  
***
*** So, to figure out the proportion of clean misses to dirty misses, we 
*** compute the footprint for each uniformly generated set.  If there is 
*** any write in that set, the set goes into the "write footprint" COMPUTE_
*** FOOTPRINT_RVAL::WFormula) -- otherwise it goes into the "read footprint" 
*** (COMPUTE_FOOTPRINT_RVAL::RFormula).  This would be more precise if we 
*** only included in WFormula those references that were actually written, 
*** and put the remainder of the footprint for that uniformly generated set 
*** into the "read footprint", but it doesn't  much matter all that much.)
***
*** So the miss penalty used is an interpolation between the clean miss
*** penalty and the dirty miss penalty, based on what proportion of the
*** footprint is read but not written.  (TODO: This is okay, but not great.
*** For example if a data item is written over and over, it may be kicked
*** out of the cache repeatedly, so there may be several dirty writes.  The
*** footprint, then, does not tell the whole story.)
***
***
*** (4.3)  Hiding Cache Misses in Computation Time 
***
*** Another detail: cache misses can be hidden to some extent by computation
*** time.  How much is stated in cache parameters.  There are two numbers in
*** the cache parameters.  If they are both 0, then there is no overlap.
*** Both numbers are between 0 and 1.  1 means fully overlapped (to the extent
*** that there are computation cycles to hide the cache misses).  If the first
*** is 1 and the second is 0.5, that means the first cache miss cycle is
*** completely overlapped, and the cache miss cycle that overlapped the last
*** computation cycle is half hidden, and it's linear in between.  That's
*** the model.  
***
*** The result is that if you have more cache miss cycles than computation 
*** cycles, of course can only hide up to "computation cycles" and with the 
*** parameters 1 and 0.5, the actual number of cycles you do hide is only 3/4 
*** of that.  If you had a third as many cache miss cycles as computation 
*** cycles, then you'd hide all of the first cache miss cycle and 2/3*1 + 
*** 1/3*0.5 (linear interpolation) = 5/6 of the last cache miss cycle, or 
*** on average 11/12 of the cache miss cycles.  You're better at hiding if 
*** you have fewer cycles to hide.

*** (4.4) The Power of Two Hack Code:  Hitting the Same Cache Line 
***
*** And another: There is the "power of two hack" code.  If the leading
*** dimension is near a big enough power of two, then we assume that reuse
*** in the middle loop is highly restricted.  We are concerned that the 
*** successive references to array elements may hit the same cache line.  
***
*** In recent releases, especially in the interprocedural optimizer, we 
*** pad arrays which have leading dimensions that are close to a power of
*** two.  This means that the "power of two hack" is invoked a lot less 
*** often than it used to be.   
***
***
*** (4.5) How Non Constant Loops Effect the Footprint 
*** 
*** The cache model is based on computing footprints.  It computes the
*** number of bytes that would go in the cache for a certain set of loops
*** with certain iteration counts.  We have changed the footprint
*** computation code to not assume reuse for loops outside non_const_loops.  
***
*** For example, A[X<non_const_loops=1>, I, J] and A[X<non_const_loops=1>, 
*** I, J] looks like it has a dependence for I=0,J=0 but that's true only 
*** for loops at or inside depth=1.  If depth=0, then X might have changed 
*** and we don't know if there's reuse.
*** 
*** So in the footprint computation, each loop in the block that has a depth 
*** less than non_const_loops, we pretend that loop is not in the block, and 
*** just compute the footprint for the other loops.  Then we multiply the 
*** iteration counts for the bad loops to get the complete footprint.  
***
*** This computation is done for an entire uniformly generated set, which 
*** is okay; in practice, all these references will have the same value for 
*** non_const_loops, so it is reasonable to use the max(non_const_loops) of 
*** all references.  This will get us both spatial and temporal locality.)
***
***
*** (4.6) Modeling the TLB 
***
*** A TLB is typically fully associative, and if it's also FIFO, then exceed-
*** ing *the number of entries even by one can be catastrophic.  So we model
*** the TLB as follows.  If a cache has a TLB, then we compute the footprint
*** with a line size of the page size (modifying the cache model to understand
*** that with a(i,j) and a(i,j+1) may go in the same line if the entries of
*** the stride-one row is small).  The cost is zero when using less than the
*** TLB, because the TLB is fully associative and our model is conservative.
*** When we overflow the TLB, we charge a penalty that is somewhat less than
*** a full miss per each TLB element.  
***
*** The reason we don't charge a full miss when we overflow the TLB is 
*** that we don't believe the model enough to charge fully. The model is 
*** too approximate in ways that the regular cache model isn't.  We are 
*** assuming that the TLB looks like a normal cache with, say, 4096 byte
*** elements, and that is not quite accurate.  For example, if an array 
*** is of dimension (5,5,5,100), then a(0,0,0,0) and a(0,0,0,1) don't
*** end up on different lines.  The model misses this important case, and
*** so is not to be trusted.
***
*** More modelling detail.  The changes described above for long cache lines
*** are useful, and so we use them in that case, but it's still rare that an
*** array dimension will actually fit into a normal cache line.  For TLBs, 
*** where the line is huge, this change may kick in more often.  
*** 
*** This is even a problem in computing the footprint.  To see this, con-
*** sider a(i,j), a(i,j+1) and  suppose a(100,100).  Without understanding 
*** that N is small compared to the cache line size, we get the footprint
*** to be 8*N*(N+511), since there are N lines using N+511 elements, if a page
*** is 512 elements.  This is too pessimistic.  The actual footprint is
*** closer to 8*N*(N+1).  Can we get an estimate which is come closer to 
*** the correct value?  Yes, in certain cases.
***
*** What we do is this.  If N is known to be such that N*element_size <= 
*** page_size, that means that a(i,j) and a(i,j+1) may share the same cache 
*** line (i.e. tlb entry).  And in fact it barely matters how many
*** times i is executed.  So what we do is replace the element size by
*** N*element_size and ignore i totally, so in the above cases we'd model
*** it as a(j) and a(j+1).  TODO OK: This is not really adequate.
*** For example, if N is unknown, but we know we go from 1 to N-1 and
*** a(i,j) and a(i+1,j), then clearly we can pull this similar trick anyway.
***
*** To make it clear, the problem is this.  If we have a(i,j), then it's
*** modelled that each stride one line is (N+cache_line-1) elements,
*** which is an accurate estimate of the number of elements that will
*** be fetched given that a cache_line holds more than one element.
*** But if we also use r rows, then we get r*(N+cache_line-1).  This is
*** basically right, but more accurate is r*N+cache_line-1.  Also note
*** that our model is the better one when we are including blocking.  So
*** the trouble is that when N is small or cache_line is large, we have
*** big problems.  This fix treats the stride one row as a single element
*** when N<=cache_line, but doesn't fix anything otherwise.  It's helpful,
*** but not ideal. [I'm not clear on the meaning of this paragraph.  What 
*** is actually done in the code, and was is suggested as a future improve-
*** ment?  I'll add more comments once I've figured it out for myself. RJC].
***
***
*** (5.0) SOME SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS  
***
*** (5.1) Reusing the Footprints and Footprint Code 
***
*** Note that footprints are recomputed over and over, because there is an 
*** F1 and an F2.  So really best just to cache the result, and adjust the 
*** v1 and v2 variable names each time as appropriate. (One of those might 
*** have to change from vn to 100 when it becomes middle.)  This is espe-
*** cially important with 2-level caching.
***
*** [It's not clear to me that the compile-time issue here is very impor-
*** tant.  Compared to software pipelining, these algorithms are still 
*** cheap.  But I did manage to reuse the footprint code in the parallel
*** model, and it would be easier to work with if it had fewer parameters
*** and produced the value of the middle loop as a variable rather than 
*** the arbitrary constant value that is generally used now. RJC]
***
***
*** (5.2) Dealing with Unusual References 
***
*** (#1) References like A(B(i)) are bad, and are placed in arl->Num_Bad().
*** They are assumed hits, i.e. they are totally ignored.  That's okay.
*** But with U(i+j*(N+1)), there's actually a lot of information.  E.g.
*** i is stride 1, j isn't, and k doesn't appear at all.  That is, it's
*** close enough to U(i,j), that we can model it that way.  That would be
*** better than what we are doing now. 
***
*** (#2) The six references: s(j-1,k,l,1), ..., s(j-1,k,l,5) and s(j,k,l,m)
*** should not use six lines in the inner loop but rather 5 if that dimension
*** only has five, implying that m is between 1 and 5.
***
*** (#3) Given the two references a(m,1,j,l) and a(m,2,j,l), the model as-
*** sumes that each reference needs N_m+cls-1 elements in the stride one 
*** loop because of the long cache lines.  In this case, with adjacent 
*** constants in the next dimension, there shouldn't be a cls-1 term. (Such
*** "edge effects" are modelled properly in most cases.) 
***
*** (#4) In (#3) above, suppose m goes from 1 to 5, but is unrolled by 2.
*** So there are three iterations of the m loop.  The model uses 3 iterations,
*** and it sees 2m and 2m+1 after unrolling.  In other words, it models m going
*** 6 times, not 5!  This is fine for large loop bounds, but in this case,
*** it overestimates the required number of words.  With this, combined with 
*** the bad edge effects mentioned in (#3), if we assume a cls of 4, a line 
*** appears to use 9 words, not 5.

// (6.0) READING THE CACHE DEBUGGING TRACE

// (6.1) The STDOUT -Wb,-tt31:0x8000 Trace

//
// For each choice of inner loop, we execute the Cache_Model() one time.

//  Adding bad reference bias:   0.5667
//  inner = 0 -> cycle est 1.73333 (before cache)  2.46337 (after cache)
//    0.663855 cache cycles  0.0661795 overhead cycles
//
// In this example, we have two caches L1 and L2, which are at Memory 
// Levels #0 and #1.  We execute One_Cache_Model() once for each trace 
// section starting with the words "Memory Level".  Hence, in this exam-
// ple, One_Cache_Model() is executed twice. 
//
// The required innermost loop is loop #0.  Note that at Memory Level #0, 
// all of the combinations in the {} on the left-hand side of the trace end 
// in for this reason.  
//
// Each line of the form:
//
//  *{1,3,0}:     Cache:  0.07378 LpOver:  0.06381 Blk: [3=24,0=52]
//
// represents a single execution of Nest_Model().  In the above example, 
// Nest_Model() is executed 8 times on the first call to One_Cache_Model()
// and 8 times on the second call to One_Cache_Model(). 
//
// In the Nest_Model trace line, the first item is the set of loops that 
// participate in the tile.  In the above example, {1,3,0} indicates that
// loops of depth 1, 3, and 0 participate in the tile.  This means that 
// the loops at depth 3 and 0 are blocked, and that the loop at depth 1 
// also carries reuse, but is not blocked. 
//
// Next we see "Cache:  0.07378".  This means that there are 0.07378  
// cycles due to cache misses per iteration of the innermost loop, given 
// this set of loops in the tile.  After that is "LpOver:  0.06381", 
// there are 0.06381 cycles due to loop overhead per itearion of the 
// innermost loop, given this set of loops in the tile. 
//
// Finally, on the line we see: "Blk: [3=24,0=52]".  This indicates that 
// the suggested blocking factors are 24 for loop 3 and 52 for loop 0. 
// Note that not all of the Nest_Model trace lines have a "Blk" component,
// those which don't are not blocked. 
// 
// The "*" before "{1,3,0}" indicates that this execution of One_Cache_Model()
// this is the best Nest_Model() choice that we have seen so far.  The cost 
// of the Nest_Model() choice can be determined by summing the "Machine" 
// "Cache" and "LpOver" numbers.  The choice with the minimum value is the 
// best nest model value.  In the above example, {1,3,0} is the best value
// for Memory Level #0. 
//
// Once we find the best value for a given memory level, we discard the 
// "LpOver" value and compute a new "DoOver" value, which we believe to 
// be more accurate.  This is done by calling Compute_Do_Ovehead().  In 
// the above trace we read: 
//
//   BEST:       Cache:  0.07378 DoOver:  0.03002
//  
// This summarizes the Cache and DoOver costs for the memory level #0. 
// 
// For this example, then, the loop nest is blocked for the L1 cache as: 
//
//   do loop-2 
//     do loop-3-tile 
//       do loop-0-tile 
//         do loop-1 
//           do loop-3 (block-size 24)
//             do loop-0 (block-size 52)
//
// We now consider blocking for the L2 cache (Memory Level #1).  Here the 
// required inner loop is #1, because the loops (2,3-tile,0-tile,1) are 
// the ones that we can no operate on, (3,0) have been placed innermost
// and will not be tiled again.  The trace shows that the best choice was:
//
//   *{3,1}:       Cache:  0.02341 LpOver: 0.0003548
//
// As before, the loop overhead was recomputed, giving us: 
//
//     BEST:       Cache:  0.02341 DoOver:  0.03616
// 
// The final loop nest will look like: 
//
//       do loop-2 
//         do loop-0-tile1 
//           do loop-3-tile1 
//             do loop-1 
//               do loop-3 (block-size 24)
//                 do loop-0 (block-size 52)
//
//  (If we choose the loop #0 to be the innermost loop.)
//
// When we have bad references in the loop, we add a factor to bias our 
// choice in favor of the required inner loop being the original inner 
// loop.  In our example, we do have bad references, and the required 
// inner loop was 3 != 0, the choice for this execution of Cache_Model().
// The bias factor is given by: 
//   Adding bad reference bias:   0.5667
// 
// The summary for this execution of Cache_Model() is given by: 
// inner = 0 -> cycle est 1.73333 (before cache)  2.46337 (after cache)
//   0.663855 cache cycles  0.0661795 overhead cycles
// This line also shows up in the normal -Wb,-tt31:0x4 trace. 
// It indicates that our best choice for a required inner loop of 0 has
// a per iteration cycle count of 1.73333 before cache and loop overhead 
// were analyzed by calling Cache_Model(), and a count of 2.46337 after 
// the cache and loop overhead figures are added in.  
//
// The part of this due to cache is 0.663855.  This comes from: 
//    0.07378  Memory Level #0 cache cost 
//    0.02341  Memory Level #1 cache cost 
//  + 0.5667   Bad reference bias 
//    ------   --------------------------
//    0.663855 Total cache cost 
//
// The part due to loop overhead is 0.0661795.  This comes from: 
//    0.03002    Memory Level #0 DoOver cost 
//    0.03616    Memory Level #1 DoOver cost  
//    -------    --------------------------- 
//    0.0661795  Total loop overhead cost 
// 
//  In this example, we have looked only at the trace for a single execution
//  of Cache_Model().  In reality, this is a 4-deep nest, and each of the 
//  four loops are legal innermost loops.  The summaries of the costs for 
//  each of these four innermost loops is: 
//
// inner = 3 -> cycle est 1.14286 (before cache)  1.14876 (after cache)
//    0.00494893 cache cycles  0.000953501 overhead cycles
// inner = 2 -> cycle est 1.1 (before cache)  2.07389 (after cache)
//    0.61118 cache cycles  0.362712 overhead cycles
// inner = 1 -> cycle est 1.1 (before cache)  1.73453 (after cache)
//    0.603523 cache cycles  0.031004 overhead cycles
// inner = 0 -> cycle est 1.73333 (before cache)  2.46337 (after cache)
//    0.663855 cache cycles  0.0661795 overhead cycles
// 
// The choice with "inner = 3" gives the minimum total cost of 1.14876,
// so this is the loop order that is finally chosen as best by the model.
// Its trace looked like: 
//
//  Memory Level #0. Required inner #3.
//  *{3}:         Cache:  0.04182 LpOver: 0.0006324
//   {2,3}:       Cache:  0.05215 LpOver: 0.001482 Blk: [3=2040]
//  *{1,3}:       Cache: 0.004968 LpOver: 0.003782 Blk: [3=680]
//   {1,2,3}:     Cache:  0.04617 LpOver: 0.001688 Blk: [3=1820]
//   {0,3}:       Cache:  0.04241 LpOver: 0.0006389
//   {0,2,3}:     Cache:  0.05213 LpOver: 0.001485 Blk: [3=2040]
//  *{0,1,3}:     Cache: 0.004949 LpOver: 0.003785 Blk: [3=680]
//   {0,1,2,3}:   Cache:  0.04618 LpOver: 0.001688 Blk: [3=1820]
//    BEST:       Cache: 0.004949 DoOver: 0.0009535
//  Memory Level #1. Required inner #0.
//    BEST:       Cache:        0 DoOver:        0
//  inner = 3 -> cycle est 1.14286 (before cache)  1.14876 (after cache)
//    0.00494893 cache cycles  0.000953501 overhead cycles
//
//  Which indicates that {0,1,3} was the best blocking for the L1 cache
//  and that no blocking was done for the L2 cache.  The final loop order
//  looks like: 
// 
//	do loop-2
//        do loop-3-tile 
//          do loop-0 
//            do loop-1 
//              do loop-3 (block-size 680)
//  
//  This is confirmed by looking at the -Wb,-tt31:0x4 trace which has: 
//   
//  Line 151: [Ivoie,Icapt,Icoef,Iecht --> Icoef(u=2),Ivoie,Icapt(u=7),Iecht 
//    block Iecht(680)[L1] outside Ivoie]
//
//  The original nest looked like:

//      do Icapt = /* loop-1 */ 
//        do Icoef = /* loop-2 */ 
//          do Iecht = /* loop-3 */  
//
//  and the transformed nest has: 
//
//    do Icoef (unrolled 2) = /* loop-2 */ 
//      do Iecht-tile = /* loop-3-tile */ 
//        do Ivoie = /* loop-0 */ 
//          do Icapt (unrolled 7) = /* loop-1 */ 
//            do Iecht (block-size 680) = /* loop-3 */

// How scared we are of "middle" loop reuse.  Below the effective cache

// Given a(i,j) and a(i,j+1), it's easy to see that they belong in the same
// RG_NODE (there's reuse) *if j is a loop to be tiled*.  We
// can even see that Bi i's and Bj j's require Bi x Bj+1 space.  We'd
// represent this situation as Mn(i) = 0, Mx(i) = 0, Mn(j) = 0, Mx(j) = 1.
// Each loop in the tile gets a Mn and Mx.  Actually, the #loops and
// #dimensions don't always match.  So that's handled by solving
// Hx = (c2 - c1) where c1 is the "representative".  the answer x gives
// a value for each dimension of interest.
//
// A nuance.  One of the loops is the stride one loop.  Maybe.  There may
// be no stride one loop, but still a stride-one value (e.g. a(1,i)).
// Thus we're forced to keep a separate stride as well.  So what do we do with
// a(i,j) and a(i+1,j)?  The answer is that Mn(i)=0 and Mx(i)=0 when
// i is the stride one loop and just use Mx_Stride and Mn_Stride.  If there
// is no stride one loop then Mn_Stride and Mn_Stride are still significant
// to catch the a(1,i) case.
//
// Reference groups don't care about multi-level blocking, except that
// a(i,j+10) and a(i,j) go in the same group even if j is not a loop to
// be tiled, but was stripped down below, or even not stripped at all,
// but is included in the inner loop.  Thus RG must be passed all the
// inner loops (and optionally their expected number of iterations)
// to form the reference groups accurately.  That in addition to all the
// loops we plan to tile here.

//   tiling has already been done inside, e.g. we are tiling for L2 and
//   we've already tiled for L1.   In that case, we multiply by the
//   iters inside.  If a loop had already been blocked 10, then 10*Var(k-1)
//   would be the number of iterations we actually execute by blocking
//   for L2 only Var(k-1).  (2) If const_answer is NULL, we compute the
//   footprint.  But if it's not, then whenever the answer is constant
//   (really, only if k==0 and outersz != -1), then it returns the answer
//   there instead and returns NULL.  Finally, if k >= nloops, this was a

/** 
*** Please see the comments at top of this file for a discussion of this
*** simple and important routine.  Note in particular the todo in that
*** section: X is guessed to be 1 instead of 3 for a(3i), a(3i+3) when there
*** is a short cache line.  That means that it thinks we are wasting cache
*** in that case when, in reality, the cache line is so short that we are
*** not.  Simple fixes for that are a disaster in the common case.  We must
*** realize that when we have a(3i), a(3i+1), a(3i+2) that we use 3 times
*** the range of i (x=3), so that we get the right answer for register
*** unrolling.
***
***	A_k = {N_k + Max_k - Min_k,             for k, non-stride1
***	      {(N_j-1)*X + cls + Max_j - Min_j  for j, stride1
***
*** This formula is good, but for multiple level blocking there is
*** a difference: N_k is to be replaced by v_k normally, but by
*** B_k*v_k when there's blocking, so that v = 10 -> ten iterations
*** of the outer stripped loop.  Also, for the loops in all_loops
*** but not loops, we know how many iterations they have, so just
*** plug it in.  This is what Formula_For_Ak hides.
***
*** k:              which loop.  0 is the middle loop.  all_loops[k]
***                 holds the depth (loop number).  That is, k is an
***                 index into all_loops.
*** v_first:        the outermost loop should map in the formula into
***                 v_first, the next into v_first+1, etc.
*** outersz:        if v_first is -1, and we are dealing with the
***                 outermost loop, then clearly we shouldn't use v_-1.
***                 Instead use the value outersz.  This value is ignored
***                 in all other cases.
*** n:              The Reference group we are determining A_k for.
*** rg:             The RG that contains n
*** inner_sz:       arl_stripsz for this loop, or if that's 0, est_iters.
*** outer_sz:       If positive, use this value as number of iters.
***                 Note that outer_sz*inner_sz*unrolls is number of
***                 iterations of orig variable, roughly.
***                 If 0, use v_(k)
***                 If -1, use v_(k-1).
*** element_size:   bytes
*** coeff:          Only used if k is the stride one loop.
***                 Elements used per cache line.  Thus non-zero.
***                 Absolute value taken, so negative okay.
*** using_tlb:      TRUE if we are modelling the TLB.
*** inner_iters_to_stop_edge_effects: if >= 1, then generate a test
***                 that removes edge effects when the number of iterations
***                 is at least this value, so long as the next outer loop
***                 is also in the nest.  For example, suppose we have
***                         do i = 1, N
***                           do j = 1, N
***                             a(i,j)
***                 If i is the middle loop, then use 1 for this value ...
***                 because we don't strip the middle loop.  Otherwise,
***                 make sure j is in the nest.  Remember, if there are
***                 v iterations of i, then the number of words used in
***                 a line is not v+3, say, but v.
***                 Now consider
***                         do j = 1, N
***                           do i = 1, N
***                             a(i,j)
***                 Same idea.
***                 The value "0" means "ignore edge effects".  In that case
***                 "unrolls" irrelevant.
*** est_iters2:     estimated iters for the edge effect loop.  Used only when
***                 inner_iters_to_stop_edge_effects is zero.
*** unrolls:        Used to help compute edge effects.  If the next outer
***                 loop is unrolled, edge effects can be reduced by that
***                 factor.

//   so that a blocksize of 10 might really mean 200, if arl_stripsz were 20.
//   That means we do 10 iterations of this next outer loop.  Now suppose

// The goal is to minimize the funtion f.  This function is piecewise
// differentiable, and so we should take the partial derivatives and solve.
// But the function is so hairy that I don't think it's a good idea.
// Better to recursively solve this problem.  We use a heuristic, that
// the minimum must occur between the smallest value thus far seen and
// its two adjacent known values.  (This is true for a function that,
// for a given B, has a negative derivative before the min and positive
// after.)

// We also only choose bsz that are multiplies of the unroll factors.
// Actually, what we do is solve for the B's, ignoring unrolling.  When
// done, we just do bsz[i] *= unrolls[loops[i]].  (so est_iters and
// exact iters must be divided by unrolls).

// It would be nice to further choose unroll factors that had something
// sensible to do with exact iteration counts (e.g. prefer a blocksize
// of 25 when N=50).  Since that makes the search non-monotonic, that
// breaks the first paragraph and so we don't do it.

// NOTE: This whole "within 2%" thing hurts monotonicity.  In fact, the fact
// that that it's integral might be a problem?  So monotonicity cannot be
// required, only a heuristic.  We run assuming monotonicity, and if the
// assumption is ever violated, we just get a less than optimal answer.

// Compute_Do_Overhead:
//
// This computes the cycles per iteration for the given loop structure.
// Note that the assumption is that the loop setup time is Loop_Overhead
// cycles.  Thus, unrolling the inner loop does not reduce overhead.
// Since we don't do inner loop unrolling, this model is in fact correct,
// but it's slightly inaccurate further out.
//
// Note that it is not feasible to say "overhead due to L1" or "overhead
// due to L2".  There is interaction between them, not a simple sum as in
// computing cache miss penalties.  So this routine just computes the total
// loop overhead and the caller to this routine must decide how to use this
// result
//
// The formula is this:
//         SUM   ( loop_overhead / (iterations from all loops inside )
//        loops
//
// Note that since the strip sizes are in terms of original iteration counts,
// we have to be careful, especially in the face of unrolling.
//
// For example, no blocking:
//
//         do i = 1, N1, 2
//          do j = 1, N2, 2
//           do k = 1, N3
//
// If o is the loop overhead, then, intuitively, we have overhead cycles/iter:
//
//         o/[(4*N3)]                      k loop
//           + o/[(4*N3)*(N2/2)]           j loop
//           + o/[(4*N3)*(N2/2)*(N1/2)]    i loop
//
// So you see that the unrolling factors interact in a complex way with the
// loop bounds.
//
// Now, suppose we have unrolls and tiling
//
//     do k'' = 1, N3
//      do i'' = 1, N1
//       do j' = 1, N2
//        do k' = k'', k''+B4-1
//         do i = i'', i''+B3-2, 2      (unrolled 2)
//          do j = j', j'+B2-2, 2       (unrolled 2)
//           do k = k', k'+B1-1
//
// If o is the loop overhead, then, intuitively, we have overhead cycles/iter:
// (e.g. note for the k' loop, it's the same denominator as for the i loop,
// but divided by B4/B1, which is how many times the k loop is executed)
//
//         o/[(4*B1)]                             k loop
//           + o/[(4*B1)*(B2/2)]                  j loop
//           + o/[(4*B1)*(B2/2)*(B3/2)]           i loop
//           + o/[(4*B4)*(B2/2)*(B3/2)]           k' loop
//           + o/[(4*B4)*(N2/2)*(B3/2)]           j' loop
//           + o/[(4*B4)*(N2/2)*(N1/2)]           i'' loop

//
// Roughly speaking, the data we need per iteration of the inner loop is F1/v1.

//                     missing 10 replications.  If there was no strip,

//    unrolls[d]:      how much loop unrolling was done for loop d.
//                     Note that arl_stripsz[d]*unrolls[d] is how many

//                           after this transformation.

//                              loops introduces.

//
// Philosophy:
// 
// The nest model is only valid when the data overflows the memory hierarchy
// level.  That's because if we have a loop like
//
//           for i
//             for j = 1,100
//               a(i,j)
//
// If the cache can hold 100 elements, then locality exists in the i loop
// even when we don't block.  So that's why One_Cache_Model checks first to
// see if the entire nest fits in the cache; if it does, we assign a cost
// of zero.  So here we know that if we consider all the loops in the nest,
// we'll overflow the cache.  And if these nests we're considering blocking
// all fit in the cache, then the model is incorrect, so we have to include
// the next loop out as well.
//
// In the case of a two deep loop, it's adequate to just return "not modelled"
// when a single loop fits in the cache, so long as we know that Nest_Model()
// will be called with both loops.  That's because when modelling both loops,
// that modelling will chose not blocking if that's the best choice.  In a
// three deep loop nest, if we want to consider
//
//       do i          do i
//        do j      =>  do k'
//         do k          do j
//                        do k
//
// we can't get that by calling Nest_Model() with 3-deep loop.  That's because
// when the inner two fit in the model, we can accurately model the blocking
// above by just modelling do i,j,k.  (That's because the inner two fit in
// the cache, so whatever you do in there doesn't matter.)  Nest_Model()
// on a three deep loop will choose that if that's best.
//
// But there's a problem.  The TLB and cache interact.  We might consider
//
//       do i          do i
//        do j      =>  do k'
//         do k          do j
//                        do k
//
// for the TLB.  But if the above fits in the *cache* (not the TLB), then we
// must model do i,j,k for the cache.  So it doesn't really help is to
// re-call Nest_Model() with more loops, and it doesn't help us to return
// no-answer, counting in further calls to Nest_Model to handle the modelling.
// So what we do instead is have nest_model itself add more and more loops
// until it can reach an answer.

//                    SNL of (k,l), 'depth' is the depth of l, ie 3.
//    stripdepth:     This is an in/out scalar.  All strips are placed
//                    outside this loop.
//    nstrips:        in/out scalar.  How many strips.
//    iloop:          in/out array.  iloop[0] holds the loop that is to be
//                    stripped to make the outermost of the strips.  Note
//                    that in other parts of the compiler, iloop[0] holds

//                    outermost strip.
//    striplevel:     in/out array.  the mhd_level for this strip, plus one.
//    permute_order:  in/out array.  As input, it's the order
//                    in which the loops occur.  In the above example, it's
//                    (0,1,2,3) or (0,1,3,2), depending upon whether we
//                    are exploring l or k innermost.  The output is the same,
//                    because One_Cache_Model never changes the inner loop.
//                    If the SNL were three deep, permute_order may change.
//                    E.g. if we have (i,j,k) and the model decides that only
//                    i should participate in a tile with k, then the permute
//                    order out will change to (j,i,k).  For multi-level
//                    blocking, we don't want to mess up what's been done
//                    before.  So we can only reorder loops outside the
//                    current stripdepth.
//    available_order:in/out array.  The loops available for blocking.  For the
//                    L1 cache, this is equivalent to permute order, but not
//                    after that.  For example, if L1 transforms "do i,j,k"
//                    into "do k',i,j,k", then j is fully blocked inside,
//                    and i is the innermost loop as far as L2 is concerned,
//                    so available order is not {i,j,k} but just {k,i}.
//    available_depth:in/out scalar.  A pointer to the number of entries
//                    minus one in available_order. (Also the depth of the new 
//		      innermost loop for this level of the cache model.) 
//    inners, ninners: in array and scalar.  The loop numbers (in no
//                    particular order) for loops that can be blocked
// 		      and are part of the fully permutable set. 
//    tiles, ntiles:  in array and scalar.  The loop numbers (in no
//                    particular order) for loops that can be blocked,
//                    but only assuming all in ninners are already blocked 
// 		      and are inside these loops.  The sets inners[] and 
//		      tiles[] are mutually exclusive.  The loops in tiles[]
//		      will not have their order changed.  
//    unrolls:        in array.  unrolls[0] says how much loop 0 has been
//                    outer unrolled.
//    est_iters:      how many times the loop will go, approximately.  Note
//                    that if it's i=1,100 but 16 unrolls, then answer is 7.
//                    This is for the original nest, before any transformation.
//    max_iters:      same as est iters if exact.  Otherwise bigger if a
//                    triangular loop and UNBOUNDED_ITERS if symbolic.
//                    This is for the original nest, before any transformation.
//    blocking_disabled: do not apply blocking.  (Basically, just compute
//                    costs for this inner loop.)
//    required_blocksize[loopno].  All loop in
//                    inners or tiles that have a >= 0 value must be
//                    included in the tile.  And they must get the specified
//                    blocking size.  Except that if it's not possible (e.g.
//                    an unroll of 2 and size of 5, or a size of 1), then
//                    just approximate.
//    mhd_level:      which cache we are working on.  -1 means no cache:
//                    just compute overheads.
//    machine_cycles: cpi for loop, ignoring cache misses
//  results:
//    cycles_per_iter:out scalar: how many cycles per iteration for
//			memory and loop overhead.  Always >=0.
//    doverhead_best  do loop overhead only.  Note that in this case
//                    and for cycles_per_iter, the loop overhead is
//                    for the entire nest, even if blocking is done
//                    for a different level.
//
// Note: iloop fills with the original loop number.  The definition
// used in other parts of the compiler is the loop number after
// permutation.

// that's good enough for the smaller also.  While such a choice might even
// be good with a large size, our approach is more robust while delivering
// very good performance for all problem sizes whether N is known or not.
// In particular, our approach will not deliver significantly worse
// performace then if we had used the dumb approach of just blocking for
// the L1 cache only.

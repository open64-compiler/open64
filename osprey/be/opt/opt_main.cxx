  HISTORY OF THE GLOBAL OPTIMIZER
  -------------------------------
  
  This is a brief history of the development of the Mongoose global
  optimizer project at SGI, with acknowledgment of the key contributors
  of the project. In 1994, as the compiler group at SGI was finishing
  the Ragnarok compiler for the MIPS R8000 processor, which was designed
  to address the scientific applications, the group recognized several
  limitations of the Ragnarok compiler.  In the second half of 1994, the
  group set out to design a new compiler that not only produces highly
  efficient code for both scientific and non-scientific applications,
  but also must be stable and fast enough to be used for day-to-day
  development of large applications.  The group also decided to overhaul
  the infrastructure of the compiler to take advantage of the latest
  advances in compiler technology.
  
  The global optimizer is not only designed to be a major optimization
  phase in the compiler, but also as a utility component that can be 
  invoked by other phases.  The IPO (inter-procedural optimization) 
  and LNO (loop-nest optimization) phases rely heavily on the global 
  optimizer for pre-conditioning the code, and their analyses and 
  processing depend on use-def and alias information generated by and 
  fed to them by the optimizer.  Design discussions on the new compiler 
  started around August. 1994. Actual development started in Oct., 1994.  
  The following is a (probably incomplete) list of features with dates 
  of the Mongoose optimizer releases.
  
  
  Release 7.0, May 1996.
  
  Most functionalities are finished in 7.0.  The major decision was to
  use SSA as *the* IR in the optimizer, contrary to using SSA form as an
  augmentation to the IR in many other compilers.  It leads to the
  development of HSSA form, and extensions to represent indirect aliases
  in SSA form.  The optimizer group also made the conscious decision to 
  divide the optimization algorithms used into two different types: 
  SSA-based and the bitvector-based.  At the time, it was not clear how 
  to perform an important optimization - partial redundancy elimination -
  in terms of SSA form, so we used the old and tried bitvector approach.
  When the compiler is released, its performance has already surpassed 
  those of the Ucode compiler and Ragnarok compiler. 
  
  Features of the release include:
  
  Symbol table & alias analysis
  * optimizer-centric symbol table
  * points-to based alias analysis
  * rule-based alias analysis for extensibility
  
  SSA 
  * HSSA form (hash-based value numbering)
  * efficient representation of aliases and indirect memory operation in SSA
  * use of zero SSA version
  * refinement of points-to analysis using SSA 
  * copy propagation without overlapping variable life times
  * induction variable recognition
  * do-loop recognition
  * dead code elimination
  * support of C++ exception handling
  
  Bitvector
  * partial redundancy elimination
  * strength reduction
  * linear function test replacement
  * induction variable elimination
  * register variable identification (register promotion)
  
  
  Release 7.1, Nov 1996.
  
  The development between 7.1 and 7.0 was relatively short.  The release
  focused on improving the stability of the optimizer, fine-tuning the
  optimizations, and improving the debuggability of the optimizer.  For
  example, we introduced heavy uses of assertions and verification
  routines in the optimizer, maximized code re-uses, and collected many
  test cases for optimizer bugs into a regression test suite.
  
  
  Release 7.2, Aug 1997.
  
  The major issue tackled in 7.2 was the undesirable separation between
  SSA-based optimizations and bitvector-based optimizations.  As
  discussed earlier, PRE was the only important optimization that did
  not have a known equivalent algorithm in the SSA domain.  The
  optimizer group was determined to solve the problem.  The outcome is
  the invention of the SSAPRE algorithm.  Strength reduction and linear
  function test replacement were later integrated into the SSAPRE
  algorithm.  In addition, we found that register promotion could
  actually be formulated as a pair of redundancy elimination problems.
  The 7.2 optimizer can compile large applications faster than 7.1 due
  to smaller memory footprint made possible by the use of SSA-based
  optimizations throughout the optimizer.  In the software engineering
  side, we started to move towards using generic programming techniques
  (using the template feature in the C++ language) to maximize
  code-reuse.  The SSAPRE implementation displays a high degree of
  code-reuse because its coding infrastructure is shared by 3 different
  optimizations based on the SSAPRE framework.  By virtue of the 3
  different incarnations of the SSAPRE concept as 3 different
  optimizations, SSAPRE is also an good example of concept-reuse.
  
  New features of 7.2 include:
  
  * alias classification: based on Steensgard's almost linear-time
    points-to analysis
  * invention of the sparse approach to PRE
      * strength reduction
      * linear function test replacement
      * busy code motion (code hoisting)
      * load and store optimization for register promotion of both scalar and 
        indirect variables (the second register promotion phase RVI2 is still
        implemented via bit vectors due to lack of manpower resources to do
        the conversion)
      * aggressive code motion (speculation of expressions)
  * second-order effect of PRE (new optimization opportunities exposed by PRE)
  * F90 support
  * new scheme for CVT optimizations 
    (important for 32 bit variables on 64-bit processors)
  * restrict pointer support
  * generalization of REGION: use optimization regions to partition program
    into smaller optimization units; exception region to support C++
    exception handling with optimizations enabled; MP region to support
    parallelization.
  * some work to avoid exponential optimization time due to the formation of
    huge trees during optimization
  * IPA support: generate sliced SSA to build IPA summary information
  
  
  Release 7.3,  May 1999
  
  At the end of release 7.2, all major parts of the optimizer input and
  output HSSA form.  This laid the foundation for performing iterative
  optimizations for Release 7.3.  As a result of iterating optimizations, 
  a 1.0 ratio for the abstraction penalty benchmark was achieved.  
  Furthermore, we started adapting the SSAPRE algorithm to deal with value 
  redundancy as well as lexical redundancy.  However, only full value 
  redundancy are optimized at the end of 7.3.  We expect extension to 
  cover partial value redundancy to be finished in future releases.  
  
  New features of 7.3 includes:
  
  * iterative global value numbering (GVN)
  * full value redundancy elimination (based on GVN)
  * live-range shrinking
     (an extension to load/store optimization in the SSAPRE framework)
  * bitwise dead and redundant code elimination 
     (elimination of dead and redundant bitwise operationss)
  * control flow optimization
     (remove partial and full redundant branches by code duplication)
  * iterative optimizations
     (capture the second-order effect optimizations)
  * linear function test replacement enhancements
  * new profile data update scheme
  
  
  SGIpro 1.0, not released yet.
  
  After release 7.3, the group started to focus on the next compiler for
  the IA-64 architecture.  Most resources were concentrated on the
  architecture-dependent portions of the compilers.  Relative few
  enhancements were made to the optimizer.  New features in osprey 1.0:
  
  * IA-64 convert opcode optimizations
     * an extension of the bitwise optimization framework done in 7.3
  * perform lowering within the optimizer to expose CVTLs specific to IA-64
  * introduce boolean data type (MTYPE_B) for better use of predicate registers 
  * new scheme to optimize bit-field accesses
     * a bit-field variable is considered an individual scalar in
       earlier phases to benefit from all scalar optimizations
     * it is lowered into the load/store of the enclosing words followed by
       bit extraction or bit composition to allow for redundancy elimination
       and load/store optimizations.
  
  
  People
  
  When the global optimizer project was started, there were four team members.
  Sun Chan has been the manager of the global optimizer group throughout most
  of its development.  His building of a high quality optimizer team and 
  his setting of high expectations are the keys to the success of the 
  project.  Fred Chow is not only the most important contributor of the 
  optimizer, but also the architect of the Mongoose compiler.  His many 
  years of experience in developing the MIPS Ucode compiler has kept us 
  on the right track.  Raymond Lo has contributed significantly to the 
  architecture of the optimizer, and has worked on almost every part of 
  the optimizer.  He succeeds Sun Chan as the manager of the optimizer group.
  Shin-Ming Liu was among the original team members, and he laid the
  overall programming methodology and coding style.  Over time, we have
  recruited additional team members that have contributed to different
  parts of the project.  The global optimizer would nowhere be as good as 
  it is today without the dedicated work of these top compiler engineers.  
  Here is a list of all the people who have contributed significantly to the 
  global optimizer, in alphabetical order:
  
  	Sun Chan
  	Fred Chow 
  	Peter Dahl
  	Rune Dahl 
  	Robert Kennedy
  	Shin-Ming Liu
  	Raymond Lo
  	David Stephenson

// class WOPT_SWITCHES
//   This class is designed to save the original global WOPT_Enable_*
//   flags.  Once all flags are saved, we can then freely adjust all
//   flags within the optimizer.  But, before we exit the optimizer,
//   we restore the global flags to their original state.
//   For the nature of this work, we use the constructor and
//   destructor of this class to call two private functions:
//
//     Adjust_Optimization(void)
//       and
//     Unadjust_Optimization(void)
//
//   The major advantage to use the destructor, is the C++ compiler
//   help assuring that the original state are restored.
//
//   Whenever you add a new flag, please follow the existing setup:
//     a. add a member, for this new flag, follow the naming
//        convention.
//     b. add a line in the constructor, to save the value in this new
//        flag. For the destructor, restore the original value.
//     c. add to Adjust_Optimization and Unadjust_Optimization, if you
//        need to adjust the flag for different phase.
//     d. all flags are in alphabetical order.  It makes easier to
//        update.

 * Description:
 *
 * This file defines the external interface to a general-purpose error
 * reporting mechanism for compilers.  Its objectives are:
 *
 *  1)	To provide a simple error reporting in the source (i.e. minimal
 *	code), with adequate options to fully describe the error.
 *
 *  2)	To require minimal effort to modify the error's description and
 *	handling.  This implies central descriptors driving the error
 *	handling, especially to deal with frequent reuse of error
 *	information (e.g. "Illegal tree node").
 *
 *  3)	To keep the error handler almost completely independent of the
 *	compiler of which it is a part, so that it can also be used in
 *	other tools, e.g. the linker and librarian.  This is achieved
 *	by using external components for program-specific material.
 *
 * ====================================================================
 *
 * The Error Reporting Interface
 *
 * In order to make use of an already-defined error message, the
 * interface defined consists of the following calls:
 *
 *  void ErrMsg (
 *      INT Error_Code,
 *      ...
 *  )
 *
 *	produces the error message associated with Error_Code, with
 *	up to six parameters.  Error_Code and parameters will be
 *	discussed further below.  The error is presumed to result from
 *	the current file and line number (discussed below), where the
 *	current line number will generally be undefined for non-front
 *	end passes.
 *
 *  void ErrMsgLine (
 *      INT Error_Code,
 *      INT line_number,
 *      ...
 *  )
 *
 *	is identical to ErrMsg, except that the relevant source line
 *	number is passed.
 *
 *  void ErrMsgSrcpos (
 *      INT Error_Code,
 *      SRCPOS srcpos,
 *      ...
 *  )
 *
 *	is identical to ErrMsg, except that the relevant source position
 *	is passed.
 *
 *  void Assert (
 *      BOOL condition,
 *      ( INT Error_Code, ... )
 *  )
 *
 *	checks for truth of the condition and, if false, invokes the
 *	equivalent of ErrMsg to report a (presumably) compiler error
 *	along with the compiler source file and line number.  The
 *	extra set of parentheses is necessary to allow cpp to process
 *	the call with arbitrary parameter count -- the condition is
 *	checked in-line.  Note that we assume that calls to Assert
 *	will be kept in production code.
 *
 *  BOOL Is_True (
 *      BOOL condition,
 *      ( const char *Format_String, ... )
 *  )
 *
 *	Similar to Assert, but performs a check expected to be removed (using
 *      cpp) in production code.  Also, notice that a format string is given
 *      instead of an error code.  Because these checks will be removed from
 *      producetion code, we decided that consistency of error reporting was
 *      less important than ease of use (in this case).
 *
 *  void FmtAssert (
 *      BOOL condition,
 *      ( const char *Format_String, ... )
 *  )
 *
 *      Just like Is_True, except will check in the production compiler as
 *      well as during development.
 *
 *  void DevAssert (
 *      BOOL condition,
 *      ( const char *Format_String, ... )
 *  )
 *
 * 	DevAssert is the same as IsTrue. Please use that instead.
 *
 * WARNING: The parameter lists for the above are currently are limited to 6
 * parameters after the error code or format string.
 *
 *  void DevWarn ( const char *Format_String, ... )
 *
 *      Issue a warning to stderr only when executed in a compiler built for
 *      development (not in MR'ed compilers).  This is a good thing to use if
 *      you have an unexpected condition from which there is a valid (though
 *      perhaps suboptimal) recovery.  For example:
 *
 *          if ( Unexpected_Condition_That_Precludes_Optimization() ) {
 *              DevWarn("Can't optimize because I was a hopeless loser");
 *              Generate_Code();
 *          }
 *          else {
 *              Optimize();
 *              Generate_Code();
 *          }
 *
 *      The warnings are issued by default if the errors package is built with
 *      horrible Is_True_On; otherwise, they are not issued.  This behavior can
 *      be changed with:
 *
 *  void DevWarn_Toggle ( void )
 *
 *      If the current behavior of DevWarn is to print the warnings, calling
 *      this supresses the warnings.  If the current behavior is to supress
 *      the warnings, calling this will enable printing them.
 *
 *  BOOL DevWarn_Enable ( void )
 *
 *      If the current behavior of DevWarn is to print the warnings, this function
 *      will return true, and fals else.
 *
 *  Lmt_DevWarn(const UINT limit, args)
 *
 *      This is a macro designed to suppress printing of DevWarn
 *      messages that get repeated a lot. At most limit copies of the
 *      DevWarn message will be printed; args is the parenthesized
 *      argument list for the function DevWarn(). In the present
 *      implementation, the position (file, line) in the compiler
 *      source is presumed to identify the message. For example, if
 *      you are a hopeless loser hundreds of times per compilation,
 *      and you feel a need to tolerate this situation for a time, and
 *      you don't wish to see hundreds of copies of the "hopeless
 *      loser" DevWarn message every time you compile, you might use:
 *
 *          if ( Unexpected_Condition_That_Precludes_Optimization() ) {
 *              Lmt_DevWarn(5,
 *                          "Can't optimize because I was a hopeless loser");
 *              Generate_Code();
 *          }
 *          else {
 *              Optimize();
 *              Generate_Code();
 *          }
 *
 *      In this example, you will see the "hopeless loser" DevWarn
 *      message at most five times per compilation.
 *
 *
 * Note that a number of predefined error codes are available,
 * including one which allows arbitrary formatting.  See erglob.h.
 *
 * The parameters passed to the error reporting routines must match the
 * message descriptor for the error code; they are used to provide
 * values inserted in the message.  The parameters are passed in a form
 * which allows them to be passed further without type knowledge, with
 * only the assumption that standard integers and pointers are the same
 * size.  The following possibilities are currently supported:
 *
 *  ET_INT:	Generic scaled integer: size of host register (INTSC).
 *  ET_INT32:	32-bit integer.
 *  ET_INT64:	64-bit integer.
 *  ET_FLOAT:	Pointer to a standard float number.
 *  ET_DOUBLE:	Pointer to a standard double float number.
 *  ET_POINTER:	Arbitrary pointer, printed as a hex number.
 *  ET_STRING:	Pointer to a standard C string.
 *  ET_SYSERR:	Unix error number.
 *  ET_STRTAB:	Pointer to a compiler string table entry.
 *  ET_SYMTAB:	Pointer to a compiler symbol table entry.
 *  ET_TN:	Pointer to a compiler temporary name struct.
 *  ET_NODE:	Pointer to a compiler tree node, representing its name.
 *
 * ====================================================================
 *
 * Error Code Definition
 *
 * In order to define a new error code for use, its value must be
 * defined in one of the error code header files erXXX.h, and a message
 * descriptor added to the descriptor file erXXX.desc.  For the
 * compiler, the possibilities for these files are:
 *
 *   erglob:	Global error codes, common to both compiler phases or
 *		other tools.
 *   erfe:	Front end error codes.
 *   ercg:	Code generator error codes.
 *   erlib:	Program library error codes.
 *   erlink:	Linker/object file error codes.
 *
 * The error message descriptors provide a printf format for the
 * message and parameter types from the above list.  They also specify
 * a severity level, one of:
 *
 *   ES_IGNORE:		To be ignored by the error message generator.
 *   ES_ADVISORY:	For user information only; not usually an
 *			indication of a problem.
 *   ES_WARNING:	A likely problem, but not a definite error.
 *   ES_CONFORMANCE:	The program does not conform in some way to the
 *			source language standard (not relevant to the
 *			first implementation).
 *   ES_ERROR:		Minimum error severity level.  All errors at or
 *			above this level prevent successful completion.
 *   ES_ERRBENIGN:	Benign error: processing continues except for
 *			code emission.
 *   ES_ERRPHASE:	Error: stop processing this source file after
 *			the current compiler phase is complete, but
 *			process any other source files before quitting.
 *   ES_ERRABORT:	Error: abort processing after minimal cleanup.
 *
 * The descriptor also identifies user vs. compiler errors.
 * See the discussion in erglob.desc for more detail.
 *
 * ====================================================================
 *
 * Error Reporting Management
 *
 * A number of global parameters must be maintained to support the
 * model assumed above.
 *
 * Error database initialization should occur very early in any process
 * that will use the facilities.  This basically points the error
 * library at the process' error table structures.
 *
 *   Set_Error_Tables(
 *     ERROR_DESC_TABLE *error_descriptor_table,
 *     char *error_list )
 *
 *  To set the descript of a particular error phase:
 *
 *   Set_Error_Descriptor (
 *     INT phase,
 *     ERROR_DESC *descriptor)
 *
 * Errors will always be reported to stderr.  In addition, they should
 * be reported to a default error file where they will be preserved
 * beyond the lifetime of a screen image.  The following routine
 * defines the file which serves this purpose, and should be called
 * when initializing a new source file for processing:
 *
 *   Set_Error_File ( const char *filename );
 *
 * Note that this routine has the side effects of closing any error
 * file which is currently open, and removing any existing file of the
 * given name.  However, the new error file is not created until a
 * reportable message occurs.  Error message emission to the trace
 * file is disabled by setting the file descriptor to NULL.
 *
 * In addition, if tracing is enabled, it is useful to have a copy of
 * all error messages embedded in the trace file.  This is enabled by
 * the call:
 *
 *   Set_Error_Trace ( FILE *stream );
 *
 * The trace file is assumed to have been opened elsewhere before any
 * error message is reported.  Note that, if tracing is directed to
 * the same file as stderr (e.g. the terminal), the extra copy will
 * be suppressed.  Error message emission to the trace file is
 * disabled by setting the file descriptor to NULL.
 *
 * All errors are reported with a source file name and line number.
 * They are maintained by calling the following routines:
 *
 *   Set_Error_Source ( char *filename );
 *   Set_Error_Line   ( INT linenum );
 *   Set_Error_Srcpos ( SRCPOS srcpos );
 *
 * To suppress line number reporting, e.g. during phases where errors
 * cannot be attributed to particular source lines, set the current
 * line to ERROR_LINE_UNKNOWN.  Note that ErrMsgLine uses the line
 * number passed by the caller instead of the current line number.
 *
 * Compiler errors (as opposed to user errors) are reported with the
 * compiler phase in which they occur.  To support this, the following
 * routine should be called at the beginning of each phase:
 *
 *   Set_Error_Phase ( const char *phasename );
 *
 * To save the current error phase for temporary changes, use:
 *
 *   char_variable = Get_Error_Phase ();
 *
 * Two global variables control the reporting of errors based on their
 * severity level:
 *
 *  Min_Error_Severity:	The minimum severity level errors to be
 *			reported (ES_WARNING by default).
 *  Conformance_Level:	The severity level of conformance errors
 *			(ES_ADVISORY by default; may be set anywhere
 *			between ES_IGNORE and ES_ERROR to control
 *			treatment).
 *
 * In order to determine whether compilation-terminating errors have
 * been detected, and in order to get an error count to report, the
 * following routine is used:
 *
 *   BOOL Get_Error_Count ( INT *Error_Count, INT *Warning_Count );
 *
 * This routine returns the number of errors and warnings up to this
 * point in its two parameters.  If any errors of level ES_ERRPHASE or
 * above have been seen, it returns TRUE, and compilation of the
 * current source file should terminate.
 *
 * Prior to other processing, and between source files, the error
 * handler should be initialized by the following routine, which
 * clears error counts, closes open error files, etc.
 *
 *   Init_Error_Handler ( INT Max_Allowed_Errors );
 *
 * Finally, as early as possible during processing, signal catching
 * with associated cleanup may be enabled by calling:
 *
 *   Handle_Signals ();
 *

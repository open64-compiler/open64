 * $Revision: 1.1 $
 * $Date: 2005/07/27 02:17:56 $
 * $Author: kevinlo $
 * $Source: /depot/CVSROOT/javi/src/sw/cmplr/common/util/mempool.h,v $
 *
 * Revision history:
 *  19-Sep-89 - Original Version
 *  24-Jan-91 - Copied for TP/Muse
 *  28-May-91 - Integrated Josie routines
 *  20-Sep-91 - Added TYPE_X_MALLOC and TYPE_ALLOC macros
 *  05-Apr-93 - Rewritten from scratch to allow statistics, better
 *              handling of large blocks.
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * This package provides a different interface from the traditional C
 * malloc/free memory allocation, and is MUCH more effecient for a
 * particular style of memory allocation common in the compiler.  In
 * this style, individual memory blocks are not freed one at a time.
 * Rather all the outstanding memory in a particular memory pool is
 * freed as a whole.  Doing this allow us to replace large numbers of
 * calls to alloc/free with only a few calls which allocate and
 * deallocate large blocks.
 *
 * Each MEM_POOL has a current allocation level.  MEM_POOLs may be
 * Push'ed onto a new allocation level or Pop'ed back to their
 * previous allocation level.  When a MEM_POOL is pop'ed, all the
 * memory allocated from it since it was pushed to its current level
 * is freed.
 *
 * Compiling all the compiler sources with -DIs_True_On and MEM_Trace_Enable
 * enables collection of memory allocation statistics.  With these it is
 * possible to see a lot of information about the callsites where
 * memory is allocated.  In particular, it is possible to see how much
 * memory allocated from each callsite is outstanding.
 *
 * Before you begin
 * ================
 *
 *      void MEM_Initialize()
 *
 *          Initialize the memory pool package.
 *
 * Global Variables
 * ================
 *
 *	MEM_POOL *Malloc_Mem_Pool
 *
 *	    If this MEM_POOL is passed as an argument to an alloc or free
 *	    routine, use malloc instead of the mempools.  
 *	    Note that it causes the use of malloc and not calloc.  Memory
 *	    from this pool will not be automatically zeroed.
 *
 *      MEM_POOL *Default_Mem_Pool
 *
 *	    Use the default MEM_POOL  
 *
 *
 * Operations defined on MEM_POOLS
 * ===============================
 *
 *	void MEM_POOL_Set_Default(MEM_POOL *pool)
 *
 *	    All subsequent uses of Default_Mem_Pool will refer to pool
 *
 *      void MEM_POOL_Initialize(
 *          MEM_POOL *pool,
 *          char     *name,
 *          BOOL      bz
 *      )
 *
 *          Must be called on a pool before it used for the other
 *          operations.
 *
 *              pool    - is a pointer to the MEM_POOL to initialize.
 *              name    - is a name to use when printing information
 *                        about it
 *              bz      - If TRUE, memory allocated from the pool will
 *                        always be zero'ed
 *
 *          After a MEM_POOL has been initialized, it is important
 *          that the structure it points to at no point go out of
 *	    scope, so MEM_POOLs initialized this way should generally
 *	    statically allocated.
 *
 *
 *      BOOL MEM_POOL_Zeroed(MEM_POOL *pool)
 *
 *	    Returns TRUE iff <pool> zeroes newly allocated memory
 *	    (i.e., if <bz> argument was TRUE when pool was initialized).
 *
 *
 *      void MEM_POOL_Push(
 *          MEM_POOL *pool
 *      )
 *
 *          Check that the pool is not frozen. If not, 
 *          push a pool to a new allocation level.
 *
 *              pool    - is a pointer to the MEM_POOL to push
 *
 *      void MEM_POOL_Push_Freeze(
 *          MEM_POOL *pool
 *      )
 *      
 *          Same as MEM_POOL_Push, except that after being pushed, 
 *          the pool is frozen for subsequent push/pop operations
 *          until the pool is unfrozen.
 *
 *              pool    - is a pointer to the MEM_POOL to push
 *
 *      void MEM_POOL_Pop(
 *          MEM_POOL *pool
 *      )
 *
 *          Check that the pool is not frozen. If not, then
 *          pop a MEM_POOL to a previous allcation level.  All memory
 *          allocated since the matching call to MEM_POOL_Push is
 *          freed.  As a special case, unmatched pop's just free ALL
 *          outstanding storage in t
 *
 *              pool    - is a pointer to the MEM_POOL to pop
 *
 *      void MEM_POOL_Pop_Unfreeze(
 *          MEM_POOL *pool
 *      )
 *
 *          Same as MEM_POOL_Pop, except that the memory pool is first
 *          unfrozen. Must be called on a frozen memory pool.
 *
 *              pool    - is a pointer to the MEM_POOL to pop
 *
 *
 *      MEM_PTR MEM_POOL_Alloc(
 *          MEM_POOL *pool,
 *          size_t    size
 *      )
 *
 *          Allocate memory from a pool.  Always double word aligned.
 *
 *              pool    - is a pointer to the MEM_POOL for allocation
 *              size    - gives the number of bytes to allocate.
 *
 *          This is a low level usage and is discouraged in favor of
 *          the TYPE_ forms below.
 *
 *	    If pool == Malloc_Mem_Pool this just calls the system malloc
 *
 *
 *      MEM_PTR MEM_POOL_Realloc(
 *          MEM_POOL *pool,
 *          MEM_PTR   old_block,
 *          size_t    old_size,
 *          size_t    new_size
 *      )
 *
 *          Reallocate memory from a pool.
 *
 *              pool      - is a pointer to the MEM_POOL for allocation
 *              old_block - is a value previously returned from
 *                          MEM_POOL_Alloc, or MEM_POOL_Realloc.
 *                          (Very important.)  It must have been
 *                          (re)allocated from the given pool. (Very
 *                          important.)
 *              old_size  - is the size used to (re)allocate old_block
 *              new_size  - is the size new allocation size.
 *
 *          Returns a block of memory 'new_size' bytes long.  The
 *          first 'old_size' byte of the returned memory contain the
 *          same values as in the 'old_block'.
 *
 *          Implementation notes: There are some cases in which this
 *          is more effecient than just allocating a new block and
 *          copying in the firrt old_size bytes.  In particular, if
 *          'old_block' was the last block of memory allocated from
 *          'pool' the reallocation will often be 'in place'.  Even if
 *          it isn't in place, the memory for 'old_block' will be made
 *          available for future by the pool package.  If it
 *          especially important to get this effect for some reason,
 *          you should consider using a dedicated pool to hold the
 *          vector that you plan to realloc.
 *
 *	    If pool == Malloc_Mem_Pool this just calls the system realloc
 *
 *
 *      void MEM_POOL_FREE(
 *          MEM_POOL *pool,
 *	    void *data
 *      )
 *
 *	    Free the data from a MEM_POOL.  If pool == Malloc_Mem_Pool,
 *	    this calls the UNIX free.  Otherwise this is a no-op.
 *
 *
 *	void MEM_POOL_Delete(MEM_POOL *pool)
 *
 * 	    Free all the memory associated with <pool>.  Currently,
 *	    deleted pools are not reported by MEM_Trace (but this can
 *	    be changed).  Note that <*pool> itself is not freed.  A
 *	    deleted pool cannot be used unless it is first initialized
 *	    again with MEM_POOL_Initialize.
 *
 *
 *  Typed allocation macros
 *  =======================
 *
 *  Use of these forms is STRONGLY encouraged as they will allow us to
 *  collect information by types as will as by callsites.  They are
 *  also terser and less error prone than bare calls to alloc with
 *  sizeof and a cast.
 *
 *      type * TYPE_MEM_POOL_ALLOC(
 *          type,
 *          MEM_POOL *pool
 *      )
 *
 *      type * TYPE_MEM_POOL_ALLOC_N(
 *          type,
 *          MEM_POOL *pool,
 *          size_t    count
 *      )
 *
 *      type * TYPE_MEM_POOL_REALLOC_N(
 *          type,
 *          MEM_POOL *pool,
 *          type     *old_block,
 *          size_t    old_count,
 *          size_t    new_count
 *      )
 *
 *          Allocate one or more objects of a particular type from a
 *          pool and return a typed pointer.  The plain form allocates
 *          a single object.  The _N for allocates a vector of such
 *          objects.
 *
 *              type        - is the name of the type to allocate.  Enough
 *                            memory is allocated to hold one (plain form)
 *                            or n (_N form) for these.
 *              pool        - is a pointer to the MEM_POOL to use,
 *              count       - How many objects (_N form only).
 *
 *	    If pool == Malloc_Mem_Pool this calls the system malloc/realloc
 *
 *
 *      type * TYPE_MEM_POOL_REALLOC_N(
 *          type,
 *          MEM_POOL *pool,
 *          type     *old_block,
 *          size_t    old_count,
 *          size_t    new_count
 *      )
 *
 *          Reallocate a vector of one or more objects.  Both the old
 *          and new vectors must be in the same pool.
 *
 *              type        - is the name of the type to allocate.  Enough
 *                            memory is allocated to hold one (plain form)
 *                            or n (_N form) for these.
 *              pool        - is a pointer to the MEM_POOL to use,
 *              old_block   - is the block of memory to reallocate.
 *                            It must have been (re)allocated from the
 *                            given 'pool'
 *              old_count   - is the number of elements allocated in
 *                            'old_block'.  It is VERY IMPORTANT that
 *                            this be accurate.
 *              new_count   - How many objects
 *
 *
 *  Tracing memory allocation
 *  =========================
 *
 *  When Is_True_On is enabled, we also support:
 *
 *      void MEM_Tracing_Enable(void)
 *
 *          Tell the memory package to collect alloc call site
 *          statistics.
 *
 *      void MEM_Trace(void)
 *
 *          Produces a report on the TFile at to memory allocation.
 *          This report starts with the low-level malloc information
 *          (see malloc(3)) provided by the -lmalloc package.
 *          Then for each pool, a list MEM_POOL_Alloc callsites is
 *          given, sorted by the maximum amount of outstanding memory
 *          at any time for each callsite.  Here is a key to the per
 *          callsite information:
 *
 *              maxt    - Maximum outstanding memory at any one time
 *              curr    - Current memory outstanding
 *              tot     - Total memory allocated from this callsite
 *              maxs    - Largest memory block allocated from this
 *                        callsite
 *              count   - Count of times callsite was executed
 *              grew    - Count of times more memory was allocated
 *                        from this callsite than last time it was
 *                        executed.
 *              shrank  - Count of times less memory was allocated
 *                        from this callsite than last time it was
 *                        executed.
 *
 *	void Trace_Memory_Allocation(
 *	    const INT phase,
 *	    const char *const pname
 *	)
 *
 *	    Produce a memory allocation trace (via MEM_Trace) when
 *	    the trace switch -ta<m> is specified on the compile line.
 *
 *		phase - Phase after which we're printing
 *		pname - Print name for phase 
 *
 * Related Utilities
 * =================
 *
 * While not strictly MEM_POOL related, the following utilities are
 * are provided:
 *
 *      type * TYPE_ALLOCA(
 *          type
 *      )
 *
 *      type * TYPE_ALLOCA_N(
 *          type,
 *          size_t    count
 *      )
 *
 *          Allocate one or more objects of a particular type using
 *	    alloca and return a typed pointer.  The plain form allocates
 *          a single object.  The _N for allocates a vector of such
 *          objects.
 *
 *              type        - is the name of the type to allocate.  Enough
 *                            memory is allocated to hold one (plain form)
 *                            or n (_N form) for these.
 *              count       - How many objects (_N form only).
 *
 * Backward Compatibility
 * ======================
 *
 * For the sake of backward compatibility, this package also supports
 * an older interface.  It's direct usage in new code is discouraged.
 * It deals with allocations from four predefined pools which are
 * never directly accessed, but are accessed via function calls.
 *
 * The four predefined pools are:
 *
 *      L       - Pushed and popped to get local utility storage
 *      Pu      - Pushed and popped to get storage that can be freed
 *                up after we are done with each program unit
 *      Src     - Pushed and popped to get storage that can be freed
 *                up after we are done with each source file.
 *      P       - Pushed and popped to get utiity storage that can be
 *                freed up when we are done with the current "phase".
 *
 * All four pools support:
 *
 *      MEM_PTR X_Alloc(
 *          size_t size
 *      )
 *
 *      TYPE_X_ALLOC(
 *          type
 *      )
 *
 *      TYPE_X_ALLOC_N(
 *          type,
 *          INT32 n
 *      )
 *
 * (Where X is one of the predefined pools.)
 *
 * Additionally, the Local pool supports:
 *
 *      void L_Save(void)
 *
 *          Pushes the L pool.
 *
 *      void L_Free(void)
 *
 *          Pops the L pool.

/* Class for automatically pushing and popping a mempool.  This is useful
 * for automatically doing a MEM_POOL_Pop() whenever we return from a
 * function, and for guaranteeing that all objects allocated from a mempool
 * are deallocated before the mempool is popped.
 *
 * Use the class within a function body, like this:
 *
 *  RETURN_TYPE my_func(...)
 *  {
 *      // mempool must have already been initialized; typically it's a
 *      // file static or global variable.  You MUST declare popper before
 *      // you start allocating storage from mempool.
 *    MEM_POOL_Popper popper(&mempool); // constructor does MEM_POOL_Push()
 *
 *      // Temporary that's no longer needed after we return from my_func().
 *      // Its declaration MUST come after popper.
 *    DYN_ARRAY<WN *> array_of_wn(&mempool);
 *      // Other temporaries allocated from mempool.
 *
 *    ... // code that allocates elements for array_of_wn and other temps.
 *
 *    if (some_condition)
 *        // Temporaries are automatically destructed and mempool is popped,
 *        // in the right order, despite early return from function.
 *      return val1;
 *
 *      // Temporaries are automatically destructed and mempool is popped,
 *      // in the right order.
 *    return val2;
 *  }
 *
 * The reason the MEM_POOL_Popper destructor call (hence also the
 * MEM_POOL_Pop()) is guaranteed to follow the destruction of objects
 * allocated from the mempool is that C++ guarantees that auto objects are
 * destructed in the reverse order of their appearance in the block (see
 * Stroustrup, "C++ Programming Language" 3rd ed., p. 245).

 * Module: glob.h
 * $Revision: 1.1.1.1 $
 * $Date: 2005/10/21 19:00:00 $
 * $Author: marcel $
 * $Source: /proj/osprey/CVS/open64/osprey1.0/common/com/glob.h,v $
 *
 * Revision history:
 *  15-Sep-89 - Original Version
 *  14-Mar-91 - Copied for TP/Muse
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * External interface to routines in the main Muse/TP compiler driver
 * module, basically very general purpose control and trace routines
 * which don't belong anywhere else.
 *
 * Also, external interface to global compiler data which doesn't
 * belong anywhere else.  See com/config.h for a general discussion
 * of where global configuration and option data declarations are
 * placed.
 *
 * All of this data is currently located in the process driver,
 * bedriver.c for the back end.
 *
 * NOTE:  This file is intended ultimately to be included in multiple
 * compiler processes.  We therefore attempt to distinguish between
 * items which are not process-specific and those which are, placing
 * the latter under the appropriate #ifdefs.

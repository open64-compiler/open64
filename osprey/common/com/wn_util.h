***                  WN walk, insert and copy routines        
***
*** Description:
***  
***  This file contains routines that operate on a given WHIRL tree
***  The operations performed on the tree include walking the tree
***  inserting a node into a block of nodes and copying a tree 
***
***
*** Reserved prefix:
*** WN_WALK    for WHIRL node walk routines
*** WN_INSERT  for WHIRL node insert routines
*** WN_COPY    for WHIRL node copy routines
*** WN_DELETE  for WHIRL node delete routines
*** WN_EXTRACT for WHIRL node extraction (but not delete) routines
*** WN_LOOP    for WHIRL node loop routines
***
***
***
*** Exported types:
***
***
***  WN_ITER
***
*** A tree node iterator. This type has one client visible field
***
***     WN *wn
***   
***       Gives the current tree node.
***
***
***
*** Exported functions:
***
***
***   WN_ITER* WN_WALK_TreeIter(
***      WN* wn)
***   
***
***   Creates and returns a tree iterator. The tree iterator iterates over
***   all nodes in the tree including structured control flow nodes,
***   statement nodes, and expression nodes
*** 
***
***   WN_ITER* WN_WALK_TreeNext(
***      WN_ITER *wni)
*** 
***
***   Walks the tree in preorder and returns the tree iterator 
***   containing the next node in the tree walk
***   
***
***
***   WN_ITER *WN_WALK_SCFIter(
***      WN_ITER *wni)
***
***   
***   Creates and returns a tree iterator. The tree iterator iterates over 
***   nodes at the structured control flow level
***
*** 
***   WN_ITER *WN_WALK_SCFNext(
***      WN_ITER *wni)
***
***   Walks the tree in preorder and returns the next node whose
***   opcode falls into the structured control flow category
***
***
***
***   WN_ITER *WN_WALK_StmtIter(
***      WN *wn)
***
***   Creates and returns a tree iterator. The tree iterator will return
***   all statement nodes and structured control flow nodes. For expressions
***   it will only return them if they are kids of structured control flow
***   nodes. 
***
***
***
***  WN_ITER *WN_WALK_StmtNext(
***     WN_ITER *wni)
***
***  Walks the tree in preorder and returns the next node, the node
***  must fall into the category described in WN_StmtIter
***
***
***
***  WN_ITER *WN_WALK_Abort(
***     WN_ITER *wni)
***
***  To exit prematurely from a tree walk a call to this routine must
***  be made. It frees the data structures used during a walk operation
***
***   
***
***  void WN_INSERT_BlockBefore(
***     WN* b, 
***     WN* wn,
***     WN* in)
***
***  To insert a node before a given node in a block node. Node "in" is
***  inserted before node "wn" in block "b". Note, wn may be NULL, in that
***  case "in" is inserted at the end. Also, "in" may be a block,
***  in which case all the statements in the block are inserted
***
***  void WN_INSERT_BlockFirst(
***	WN* b,
***	WN* in)
***
***  To insert a node before the first node in a block.  Note, "in" may be
***  a block, in which case all the statements in the block are inserted.
***
***
***  void WN_INSERT_BlockAfter(
***     WN* b, 
***     WN* wn,
***     WN* in)
***
***  To insert a node after a given node in a block node. Node "in" is
***  inserted after node "wn" in block "b".  Note, "wn" may be NULL, in that
***  case "in" is inserted at the beginning. Also, "in" may be a block,
***  in which case all the statements in the block are inserted
***
***  void WN_INSERT_BlockLast(
***	WN* b,
***	WN* in)
***
***  To insert a node after the last node in a block.  Note, "in" may be
***  a block, in which case all the statements in the block are inserted.
***
***
***
***  WN* WN_COPY_Tree(
***    WN* wn)
***
***  To copy node wn.
***  No annotations are copied at this point. This is strictly a tree copy,
***  and a recursive one
***
***  WN* WN_COPY_Tree_Without_Commas(
***    WN* wn)
***
***  Same as WN_COPY_Tree() except operations with side effects are excluded
***
***
***  WN* WN_COPY_Tree_With_Map(
***    WN* wn)
***
***  To copy node wn and its map.
***  This is strictly a tree copy, and a recursive one
***
***
***  void WN_COPY_All_Maps(
***    WN* dst,
***    WN* src)
***
***  To copy all maps from src to dst.
***
***
***  void WN_DELETE_Tree(
***     WN *tree)
***
***  Deletes a tree recursively. No annotations are deleted at this point. 
***  
***
***  WN* WN_DELETE_FromBlock(
***       WN* blck, 
***       WN* wn)
***
***  To delete node "wn" from a BLOCK node. Note, WN_DELETE_Tree is called 
***  which is a recursive delete, it deletes all the kids.
***
***  WN *WN_EXTRACT_FromBlock(
***       WN *parent,
***       WN *item)
***
***  Extract node "item" from a BLOCK, but don't delete it.
***
***  WN *WN_EXTRACT_ItemsFromBlock(
***       WN *parent,
***       WN *first_item,
***       WN *last_item)
***  Extract nodes between first_item and last_item from a BLOCK,
***  but don't delete them.
***
***  WN *WN_LOOP_InductionVariable(
***	  const WN *loop)
***
*** Determine the loop's induction variable.  Returns either an
*** IDNAME or LDID.  If unable to determine it, returns NULL.
***
***  WN *WN_LOOP_LowerBound(
***	  const WN *loop)
***
*** Determine the lower bound of the loop, which is basically
*** the value stored to the induction variable to initialize
*** the loop.  If unable to determine it, returns NULL.
***
***  WN *WN_LOOP_UpperBound(
***	  const WN *loop,
***       OPCODE *compare)
***
*** Determine the upper bound of the loop, which is basically
*** the value which can not be exceeded (going in either
*** direction (positive dir if increment is positive, or
*** negative direction is increment is negative
*** Also returns the comparison operator to know how the iv is
*** related to this upper bound.  We canonicalize it so the iv
*** is always on the lhs of the comparison, and the upper bound
*** is always on the rhs:  iv <,<=,==,!=,>=,> upper bound
*** If unable to determine it, returns NULL.
***
***  WN *WN_LOOP_Increment(
***	  const WN *loop,
***       BOOL *is_incr)
***
*** Determine the increment (if is_incr = TRUE) value
*** the value which can not be exceeded (going in either
*** direction (positive dir if is_incr is true, or negative
*** direction if is_incr is false (actually decrements iv)
*** If unable to determine it, returns NULL.
***
***  WN *WN_LOOP_TripCount(
***	  const WN *loop)
***
***  Determine the trip count, which may be a LDID, or INTCONST
***  If unable to determine it, returns NULL.
***
***  WN_object_ty(const WN *) 
***    Obtain the high level type of the object being accessed.
***
***  WN_hl_object_ty (const WN*, TY_IDX& ty, UINT32& fld_id)
***    Obtain the higher level type of object being accessed.
***
***  WN_object_size(const WN *)
***    Obtain the size of the object being accessed.
***
***
***
***
***
***  void Add_Pragma_To_MP_Regions (WN_VECTOR *wnv, 
***                                 WN_PRAGMA_ID pragma_id,
***                                 ST *st, WN_OFFSET ofst,
***                                 WN_MAP parent_map,
***                                 BOOL make_compiler_generated)
***     Given a vector of WHIRL-MP regions innermost to outermost
***     (i.e. the innermost MP region is first, outermost is last)
***     add a pragma of the given type for the given ST *as required* 
***     to the MP regions. The algorithm for adding pragmas 
***     currently works for LOCAL and SHARED pragmas only.
***     Also, if the parent_map is non-NULL, then update the
***     parent-map when inserting.

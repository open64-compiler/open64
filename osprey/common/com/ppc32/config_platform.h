 * Module: config_platform.h
 * $Revision: 1.1.1.1 $
 * $Date: 2005/10/21 19:00:00 $
 * $Author: marcel $
 * $Source: /kpro64/common/com/ia64/config_platform.h,v $
 *
 * Revision history:
 *  11-May-96 - Original Version
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * Definitions of the various platforms supported by the compiler.
 * This package is used to configure certain platform-specific options
 * like the -Ofast option set and cache configuration for LNO.
 *
 * This is separate from config_targ.h because it has a very small set
 * of clients, whereas config_targ.h is included in config.h and hence
 * everywhere.
 *
 * NOTE:  There is an outstanding bug, PV 378171, to base this
 * functionality on an external configuration file.
 *
 * WARNING:  This header should be usable by the driver, so it should
 * be clean of special compiler types.

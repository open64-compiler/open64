 * The WHIRL subsection header information is stored internally as a

 * structure records the current state and its position in memory or
 * in a file.  The pointer to the structure in memory overlaps with the
 * subsection size, so that the subsection file offset is still available
 * after reading the structure into memory.  (Some subsections refer to
 * WN nodes by their offsets within the WT_TREE subsection, and we need
 * to convert those references to pointers.)  To identify the PU,
 * the ID for the procedure symbol is also stored in the file.  This
 * can be converted to a pointer to the actual ST, and so we also keep
 * track of which form is stored.  The state flags are described below.

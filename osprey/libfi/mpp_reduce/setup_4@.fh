*     This is the guts for the intermediate Fortran routines for

*
*     This code sets up the arguments for the work routines. This setup
*     cannot be done in the work routine itself because the source array
*     is coerced private in the work routine. This implies that the
*     programming model intrinsics blkct, hiidx, lowidx, and pes cannot
*     be used in the work routine.

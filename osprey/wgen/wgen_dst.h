 * Module: wfe_dst.h
 * $Revision: 1.10 $
 * $Date: 05/12/05 09:00:09-08:00 $
 * $Author: bos@eng-24.pathscale.com $
 * $Source: kg++fe/SCCS/s.wfe_dst.h $
 *
 * Revision history:
 *  11-May-93 - Original Version
 *
 * Description:
 *  Extracts from the EDG front-end intermediate representation the
 *  information necessary for the back-end to generate the dwarf 
 *  debugging sections.  Currently, we only supply search-path 
 *  directories, file-descriptors, and scope and declarative information.
 *  In the future we may also supply preprocessing infoamtion.
 *
 *  The subroutines exported through this interface have the following
 *  intended usage and functionality:
 *
 *
 *  DST_build():   ---- wfe_dst.c
 *     Creates DST entries for all declared variables, subroutines,
 *     labels, and types.  This call will also enter file-descriptors
 *     and include directories.  This procedure should only be called
 *     after the EDG front-end processing is complete.  When not in
 *     debugging mode, only file/directory descriptors are entered.
 *     
 *  DST_get_ordinal_file_num():    ---- wfe_dst.c
 *     Should always be called through the macro DST_FILE_NUMBER!  Enters
 *     the file-name into a file-list and returns its ordinal number in 
 *     that list.  If the (full) path name for the file has been seen 
 *     before, then the previous ordinal number is returned and the name 
 *     is not entered into the list a second time.
 *
 *  DST_enter_weak_subroutine():   ---- wfe_dst.c
 *  DST_enter_weak_variable():     ---- wfe_dst.c
 *     Assumes the secondary is a DST_SUBPR_DECL/DST_VAR_DECL and sets 
 *     its "origin" field to the DST_IDX of the primary.
 *
 *  DST_enter_inlined_subroutine(); ---- wfe_dst.c
 *     Called from inline_call_nd in edexpr.c, this generates the DST entries
 *     for an inlined subroutine and its formal parameters and local
 *     variables.
 *
 *  DST_write_to_dotB():      ---- wfe_dst.c
 *     Writes the DST structure out to the .B file, assuming the .B
 *     header information already has already been written out
 *     (through a call to Write_Dot_B_Header).  Also dumps the
 *     DST to file, provided DSTdump_File_Name!=NULL (see "glob.h").
